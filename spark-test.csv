Breast_Cancer "In this case, apoptosis-deficient Becn1+/+ iMMECs stably expressing ERBB2 under low (1%) oxygen and glucose-deprivation conditions showed decreased number of autophagosomes compared with their non-ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/+ counterparts (Fig. 2F and G). Interestingly, the level of autophagy induction in metabolically stressed ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/+ iMMECs was similar to that of vector-expressing Becn1+/? iMMECs (Fig. 2F and G), confirming that ERBB2 overexpression renders mammary epithelial cells partially autophagy-deficient under stress. To further investigate the impact of ERBB2 overexpression on stress-induced autophagy in an alternate system and in an apoptosis-competent background, we used a transient ERBB2 expression system.40 To this intent, Becn1+/+ iMMECs stably overexpressing EGFP-LC3B were transiently transfected with a ERBB2-expressing or vector control plasmid and, after overnight recovery in regular culture medium, were incubated in Hanks medium for up to 3.5 h. Similar to the results described above (Fig. 2B�E), transient ERBB2 overexpression did not affect basal autophagy, but suppressed autophagy induction in wild-type iMMECs in response to nutrient deprivation (Fig. 3A�D, P < 0.01). This result was confirmed by decreased LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion in iMMECs transiently overexpressing ERBB2 in both the absence and presence of BafA1 (Fig. 3C and D). ERBB2 overexpression did not affect expression of the essential autophagy regulators BECN1 and ATG7 (Fig. S2), but resulted in decreased conversion of endogenous LC3B-I to LC3B-II (Fig. 3C), indicating that ERBB2-promoted suppression of the autophagic response to stress was not associated with alterations in ATG expression.

(E) EGFP-LC3B-expressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs transiently transfected with a ERBB2-expressing or vector control plasmid were subjected to nutrient deprivation, and autophagy was quantified by the number of GFP-fluorescent puncta per cell. Each data point is an average of triplicate experiments � SD after quantifying puncta in 100 cells per experiment. *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01. Finally, when EGFP-LC3B-expressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs were transiently transfected with a ERBB2-expressing or vector control plasmid and subjected to nutrient starvation, ERBB2 overexpression in either Becn1+/+ or Becn1+/? iMMECs induced similar number of autophagic puncta to those observed in vector-transfected Becn1+/? iMMECs (Fig. 3E, P < 0.05), indicating that ERBB2 expression rendered mammary epithelial cells autophagy-defective, independent of allelic Becn1 status. The effect of ERBB2 overexpression on the functional status of autophagy in human breast cancer cells was examined by transfection of stably EGFP-LC3B-expressing MCF7 cells with an ERBB2-expressing or vector control plasmid. Similar to the iMMEC results described above (Fig. 2; Fig. 3), transient ERBB2 expression did not alter basal autophagy levels in MCF7 cells, but suppressed autophagy induction in response to nutrient starvation (Fig. 4A and B). Inhibition of autophagic flux by bafilomycin A1 resulted in higher GFP puncta accumulation per cell in vector-compared with ERBB2-expressing MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A and B, P < 0.05), again indicating that the ERBB2 signaling pathway decreases autophagy induction in response to stress and, thus, suggesting that ERBB2-positive breast tumors may be functionally autophagy-defective, independent of BECN1 expression. Figure 4. Transient ERBB2 overexpression inhibits stress-induced autophagy in human breast cancer cells. (A) GFP-fluorescence microscopy of EGFP-LC3B-expressing MCF7 cells transiently transfected with a ERBB2-expressing or vector control plasmid under nutrient deprivation conditions for 0, 1, and 2 h without and with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1, 25 nM). (B) Autophagy quantification of (A) based on number of GFP-fluorescent puncta per cell. Each data point is an average of triplicate experiments � SD after quantifying puncta in 100 cells per experiment. *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01. (C) GFP-fluorescence confocal microscopy of tumor cell plaques dissected 24 h post orthotopic implantation of BCL2-expressing Becn1+/+ (left panel), BCL2- and ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/+ (middle panel), and BCL2 expressing Becn1+/? (right panel) iMMECs in nude mice. To examine the effect of ERBB2 overexpression on the functional status of autophagy in vivo, BCL2-, ERBB2- and EGFP-LC3B-expressing Becn1+/+ iMMECs, as well as BCL2-expressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs, were orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of nude mice. Plaques were dissected 24 h post iMMEC implantation and LC3B translocation was qualitatively evaluated using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Similar to Figures 2D and 3E, ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1+/+ mammary cells exhibited similar number and size of GFP-LC3B puncta to Becn1+/? cells in vivo, but fewer and smaller in size puncta than Becn1+/+ cells (Fig. 4C). Monoallelic Becn1 loss does not alter ERBB2- and PyMT-driven mammary tumorigenesis To investigate whether allelic Becn1 status impacts ERBB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis, ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs were orthotopically implanted in NCR nude female mice. The kinetics of allograft mammary tumor formation were independent of Becn1 status (Fig. 5A), indicating that, in our mouse mammary epithelial model,37 monoallelic Becn1 loss does not alter ERBB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Mammary tumors generated by ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs exhibited similar ERBB2, MKI67 (Ki67) and cleaved CASP3 levels, indicating that ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMEC-generated tumors were similar in oncogene expression and in cell proliferation and death rates. However, given lower total LC3B expression, but similar SQSTM1 levels in Becn1+/? compared with Becn1+/+ tumors (Fig. 5B), differences in the functional status of autophagy could not be reliably determined. Figure 5. ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMECs have similar tumor-forming capacities in nude mice. (A) Independent ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? iMMEC lines (e.g., A and B) were bilaterally implanted into the 3rd mammary fat pads of nude mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth. Each data point represents the average volume of iMMEC-generated mammary tumors in 5 mice (2 tumors per mouse) per genotype � SD (B) Representative images of ERBB2, LC3B, SQSTM1, MKI67, and cleaved CASP3 expression, as determined by IHC, in ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/+ (Becn1+/+;ERBB2) and ERBB2-expressing Becn1+/? (Becn1+/?;ERBB2) iMMEC-generated allograft mammary tumors from (A). The functional interactions between the ERBB2 and autophagy pathways were further studied by crossing Becn1+/? mice to 2 well-characterized mouse mammary tumor models, namely the MMTV-Neu42 and MMTV-PyMT43 models, which show cosegregating tumor gene expression profiles when compared with other mouse mammary tumor models.44 Similar to the iMMEC studies described above (Fig. 5A), monoallelic Becn1 loss did not alter the incidence, MMTV-latency or multiplicity of ERBB2-induced mammary tumors, independent of parity status (Fig. 6A). Similar ERBB2, but lower BECN1 and LC3B, levels were observed in Becn1+/?;Neu compared with Becn1+/+;MMTV-Neu mammary glands (Fig. 6B). Figure 6.

(D) Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and ERBB2, BECN1, and LC3B expression by IHC in mammary tumors from Becn1+/+;MMTV-Neu and Becn1+/?;MMTV-Neu virgin mice. Mice used: Becn1+/? (C57BL/6); MMTV-Neu (FVB/N). It is of interest to note that the cross between Becn1+/?8 and MMTV-Neu mice resulted in a mixed C57BL/6:FVB (50:50) background and mammary tumors arose with greater latency and lower penetrance in Becn1+/+;MMTV-Neu mice than in the FVB/N MMTV-Neu model,42 in agreement with earlier reports that the C57BL/6 background suppresses ERBB2-induced mammary tumor formation.45,46 To generate a Becn1+/? mouse model that is more readily amenable to mammary tumorigenesis studies, we changed the genetic background of the Becn1+/? mice from C57BL/68 to FVB/N. Rather than repeating the lengthier cross with MMTV-Neu mice, we instead crossed FVB Becn1+/? mice to the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, which develops mammary tumors in all mammary glands within 6 to 8 wk43 and is frequently used as a surrogate model for ERBB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis, as NEU- and PyMT-induced mammary tumors exhibit cosegregating gene expression signatures and high ERBB2 expression.47 Similar to the cross between Becn1+/? and MMTV-Neu mice (Fig. 6A), Becn1 heterozygosity did not impact PyMT-induced mammary tumorigenesis (Fig. 7A). Compared with Becn1+/+;MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors, Becn1+/?;MMTV-PyMT tumors exhibited lower BECN1 expression, but comparable ERBB2, LC3B, SQSTM1 and MKI67 levels (Fig. 7B), indicating that cell proliferation and likely functional autophagy status in PyMT-driven mammary tumors were not affected by monoallelic Becn1 deletion. Figure 7. Monoallelic Becn1 loss does not impact PyMT-driven mammary tumorigenesis. (A) Kaplan-Meier curve depicting percentage of tumor-free virgin mice over a period of 100 d post birth.

(FVB/N); MMTV-PyMT (FVB/N). Autophagy inhibition enhances the response of tzb-responsive human breast cancer cells to trastuzumab Our findings that ERBB2-positive breast tumors often exhibit low BECN1 expression (Fig. 1), ERBB2 overexpression suppresses stress-induced autophagy in mammary tumor cells in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2�4), and Becn1 heterozygosity does not impact ERBB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis in the mouse tumor models examined (Figs. 5�7) suggest that, in contrast to mutant RAS-driven tumors,38,48-50 ERBB2-overexpressing cancer cells do not depend on high functional autophagy levels for growth. It is possible, however, that the suppressed, but not absent, autophagic potential is still essential for ERBB2-positive cancer cell survival under stress and that further autophagy inhibition may promote tumor cell death. To investigate this clinically significant hypothesis, we examined whether pharmacological or genetic autophagy inhibition increased sensitivity of the ERBB2-positive human breast cancer cell line, BT474, to the humanized mouse monoclonal ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab.51 Previous reports have shown that tzb-sensitive BT474 cancer cells exhibit low levels of basal autophagy and fail to upregulate autophagy in response to stress to the levels of other human breast cancer cell lines,33,52,53 further supporting our finding that ERBB2 overexpression suppresses autophagy. As shown in Figure 8A, trastuzumab inhibited BT474 cell growth at 48 and 72 h of treatment (P < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively), whereas the lysosomotropic agent and indirect autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), at a concentration that blocks autophagic flux (25 ?M, Fig. 8B and C), had minimal effect on BT474 cell growth. The combination of trastuzumab and CQ showed statistically significant enhanced antitumor effect relative to the single agent trastuzumab (Fig. 8A), indicating that pharmacological autophagy inhibition with CQ augments the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab on tzb-sensitive BT474 breast cancer cells (P < 0.05). Near-complete BECN1 knockdown with siRNA (Fig. 8E) did not affect BT474 cell growth, but increased the antitumor effect of trastuzumab at 72 h (Fig. 8D, P < 0.05), indicating that targeted suppression of BECN1 expression also impacts ERBB2-positive breast cancer cell responsiveness to trastuzumab. Figure 8. Autophagy inhibition sensitizes tzb-responsive ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells to trastuzumab.

Each data point is an average of triplicate experiments � SD. *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01. ERBB2-positive human breast tumors exhibit a low autophagy gene signature independent of BECN1 mRNA status Given our initial observation that low BECN1 expression in human breast tumors correlates with the ERBB2 and basal-like subtypes in independent, but rather small, gene profiling databases (Fig. 1), we examined whether this finding holds true in much larger and unrelated breast cancer cohorts.54-57 Tumors were clustered into 4 subgroups based on BECN1 expression levels [high (BECN1+) vs. low (BECN1?) for BECN1 levels above or below the mean across samples, respectively] and reported ERBB2 status [positive (ERBB2+) vs. negative (ERBB2?)] and their expression profiles were compared regarding hormone receptor status, autophagy-related gene expression, and gene signatures of metabolic pathways (Fig. S3) previously reported to be affected by functional autophagy status.38,48,49,58-60 This analysis confirmed that ERBB2-positive and triple negative breast tumors commonly express low levels of BECN1 mRNA (Fig. 9, Fig. S4, P = 5.70E-18). We also discovered that ERBB2-positive tumors, independent of BECN1 expression and very similar to non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-low tumors, exhibited low expression of autophagy-regulated genes, possibly indicating functional autophagy suppression in ERBB2-positive breast cancers even when BECN1 is highly expressed (Fig. 9, Fig. S4, P = 2.60E-03). It is of great interest and worthy of further investigation that, similar to non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-low tumors and in contrast to non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-high tumors, ERBB2-positive breast tumors showed decreased fatty acid ?-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation gene signatures, independent of BECN1 expression. Intriguingly, ERBB2-positive breast cancers seem to have glycolysis and cell proliferation gene signatures between the significantly upregulated and significantly downregulated patterns observed in non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-low (i.e., mostly triple negative) and non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-high (i.e., mostly hormone receptor-positive) tumors, respectively (Fig. 9, Fig. S4, P = 1.60E-05 and P = 3.10E-06). Figure 9. ERBB2-positive breast cancers have, independent of BECN1 expression, gene expression signatures similar to those of non-ERBB2-expressing breast cancers with low BECN1 mRNA levels. The heatmap reports gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for selected gene signatures (rows) in breast cancer cohorts defined by ERBB2 and BECN1 status. The color indicates the enrichment (Fischer exact test) of samples with gene signature upregulation (red, P+, enrichment < 0.05), downregulation (blue, P?, enrichment < 0.05), or no difference (black, P+, enrichment ? 0.05 and P?, enrichment ? 0.05) within a cohort subgroup relative to the remaining samples in the cohort. Gene signature lists and statistical analysis are provided in Figures S3 and S4, respectively.

Discussion Role of autophagy in mammary tumorigenesis The human epidermal growth factor receptor and tyrosine kinase ERBB2 has been widely studied because of its strong transforming potential, its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and its use as a therapeutic target in patients with ERBB2-positive breast tumors. ERBB2 amplification is likely an early genetic event in mammary tumorigenesis, as it is commonly observed in ductal carcinoma in situ, in the absence of invasive disease.61 ERBB2 status remains constant as disease progresses to invasive and then metastatic stages.62-65 Becn1 has been identified as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, as Becn1+/? mice develop mammary hyperplasias, lymphomas, and lung and liver carcinomas, which retain a wild-type Becn1 allele.4,7 Epithelial cells with autophagy defects, including Becn1 heterozygosity, exhibit susceptibility to metabolic stress, which is accompanied by DNA damage and increased genomic instability, in turn likely driving cancer progression.4 In our study, and in agreement with earlier work,14 ERBB2 overexpression and low BECN1 mRNA levels are positively correlated in human breast cancers (Fig. 1), indicating that many ERBB2-positive breast malignancies may be functionally autophagy-deficient. In support of this hypothesis, we found that ERBB2 axis activation suppresses stress-induced autophagy (Figs. 2�4), suggesting that ERBB2-positive premalignant and malignant breast lesions may exhibit decreased autophagic potential, even if BECN1 is genomically intact. Given the contribution of allelic Becn1 loss to DNA damage and genomic instability,4 it is conceivable that, by functionally suppressing autophagy, early ERBB2 activation may lead to further ERBB2 amplification and, thus, a positive feedback loop maintaining and increasing the protumorigenic function of the ERBB2 axis. In this case, defective autophagy, but not necessarily allelic BECN1 deletion, may indeed play a role in ERBB2-positive breast cancer, particularly during tumor initiation. Recent studies support the concept that autophagy suppression is important for aberrant tyrosine kinase-induced tumorigenesis, such as those mediated by AKT1 and EGFR,66,67 which inhibit autophagy by phosphorylation of BECN1. Upon expression of a BECN1 mutant resistant to phosphorylation in cancer cell lines, autophagy could not be inhibited and tyrosine kinase-mediated xenograft tumor formation in nude mice was suppressed.66,67 It would be very informative to further investigate the role of autophagy in ERBB2-induced tumorigenesis by generating a transgenic mouse model that combines ERBB2 overexpression and a constitutively activated or non-suppressible autophagy status. As it is evident from our in vitro and in vivo allograft and spontaneous tumorigenesis studies, unless autophagy is ectopically induced or engineered to be in a �nonsuppressible state,� activation of the ERBB2 axis suppresses the autophagic response to stress and renders ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells autophagy-deficient, thus providing an explanation for why partial Becn1 deficiency does not impact ERBB2-driven mammary tumor formation (Figs. 5�7). Our bi-transgenic mouse models combining monoallelic Becn1 loss and ERBB2 or PyMT activation under the MMTV-promoter join the efforts to study the role of defective autophagy in mammary tumorigenesis using mammary tumor-prone mouse models.68,69 In the first such publication, mammary gland-targeted deletion of the positive autophagy regulator Rb1cc1/Fip200 suppresses mammary tumor initiation and progression in the MMTV-PyMT model, in association with defective autophagy in tumor cells, as indicated by accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and SQSTM1, deficient LC3B conversion, and increased number of abnormal-appearing mitochondria.68 In a more recently published study, monoallelic Becn1 loss suppresses mammary tumor formation driven by Palb2 deletion in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in a wild-type Trp53 background, but fails to impact tumorigenesis induced by combined MEC-specific Palb2 and Trp53 loss,69 suggesting that the role of allelic Becn1 status in mammary tumorigenesis is greatly influenced by other oncogenic events. The results mentioned above, including our studies, once more indicate that the role of autophagy in breast cancer is complex and warrants further investigation. Autophagy modulation for ERBB2-positive breast cancer treatment Our treatment studies (Fig. 8) demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increases sensitivity of tzb-responsive breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, indicating that the functionally reduced autophagy status in ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells still preserves cell viability and provides protection against chemotherapy. This finding is in agreement with previously published studies, which implicated autophagy in resistance to breast cancer treatment, as autophagy inhibition by CQ or silencing of Atg genes resensitized tzb-resistant SKBR3 cells and hormone-resistant MCF7 cells to trastuzumab and tamoxifen, respectively.33,70 Tumor cell addiction to autophagy The suppressive effect of ERBB2 overexpression on the functional status of autophagy is in sharp contrast to the upregulation of basal autophagy and the strong dependence of RAS-mutant tumors on autophagy for growth.38,48-50,58 RAS-mediated adhesion-independent transformation is dependent on autophagy, as autophagy inhibition reduced glycolytic capacity and attenuated cell proliferation and transformation.48 Furthermore, RAS-expressing cells have high basal autophagy to maintain a functional mitochondrial pool and meet energy demands imposed by oncogenic RAS, as autophagy suppression decreased tumor cell survival under starvation and abrogated tumorigenesis in nude mice, in association with depletion of oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates.38,49 Whereas the aforementioned work38,48-50,58 suggests an oncogene-induced requirement for autophagy induction during tumorigenesis, our present studies indicate that �autophagy addiction� is not a generalized phenomenon in cancer pathophysiology, but its activation is instead specific to particular oncogenic events. Despite the differences in autophagy functional status in RAS-mutant and ERBB2-positive tumors and the potentially discrete roles of defective autophagy in RAS- and ERBB2-driven tumor initiation and maintenance, our studies reveal a common role for autophagy in resistance to cancer therapy. Similar to the sensitization of different tumor types to standard anticancer agents,13,71-73 tzb-responsive breast cancer cells were rendered more sensitive to trastuzumab by pharmacological and genetic autophagy suppression, thus further supporting use of autophagy inhibitors in combination with conventional cancer therapies. Autophagy functional status in ERBB2-positive breast tumors Our finding that ERBB2 activation suppresses stress-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2�4) is in agreement with our analysis of human breast tumor DNA microarray data showing that ERBB2-expressing breast cancers exhibit lower expression of autophagy-related genes (Figs. S3 and S4), independent of BECN1 expression levels (Fig. 9). It is, thus, likely that ERBB2-positive breast tumors are functionally autophagy-defective and, similar to Becn1+/? iMMECs,74 sensitive to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agents; this hypothesis will be investigated in subsequent studies. An interesting and thought-provoking finding from our gene expression analysis is the striking downregulation of glycolysis and proliferation gene signatures in non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-high breast cancers, which are highly enriched in hormone receptor-positive tumors and also exhibit high and relative upregulation of fatty acid ?-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation gene signatures, respectively. ERBB2-positive breast cancers, independent of BECN1 expression, are characterized by a relative upregulation of glycolysis and proliferation gene signatures compared with non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-high (mostly hormone receptor-positive) tumors, but not to levels observed in non-ERBB2-expressing BECN1-low (mostly triple negative breast) tumors. Upregulation of glycolysis in association with ERBB2 activation has been reported before.75-77 However, the high expression of glycolysis-related genes in conjunction with a low autophagic gene signature is surprising considering that, in RAS-mediated transformation, defective autophagy reduces glycolytic capacity.48 It is possible that breast tumors with high functional autophagy do not rely on glycolysis for meeting their metabolic demands, as fatty acid ?-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation can be sustained at high levels in autophagy-maintained healthy mitochondria. In contrast, low BECN1 expression, and likely defective autophagy and deregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis, correlates with significant suppression of fatty acid ?-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, as previously reported,38,60 thus forcing the cancer cell metabolic machinery toward glycolysis. "
Breast_Cancer " The relationship between autophagy regulation and metabolic reprogramming is obviously quite complex,58 and further studies are needed to explore the metabolic profiles of the different breast cancer subtypes and incorporate the knowledge acquired in the design of more effective therapeutic regimens. Materials and Methods Cell line generation and culture conditions Primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (pMMECs) from Becn1+/+ and Becn1+/? mice8 were immortalized to generate iMMEC cell lines, which were then engineered to stably express BCL2, EGFP-LC3B or wild-type human ERBB2, as previously described.4 The BT474 (HTB-20) cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Hank�s balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, 14025-092) was used for nutrient-deprivation studies. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1; Sigma-Aldrich, B1793) was used at a concentration of 25 nM. Fluorescence and electron microscopy Autophagy was quantified by quantification of EGFP-LC3B puncta per cell using fluorescence microscopy, using an Olympus IX51 fluorescent microscopy system at 60� magnification. One hundred cells per cell line were evaluated for number of EGFP-LC3B puncta per cell at each time point. Three independent experiments were performed, and the average number of GFP-fluorescent puncta per cell with standard deviation for each cell line at each time point is presented. For EM, cells were fixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, 8 �M calcium chloride, 0.1 M cacodylate, pH 7.4 fixative buffer. Electron microscopy was performed with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at 3800� magnification. Statistical analysis (2-tailed Student t test) was performed by Excel�s Data Analysis ToolPak (Microsoft, www.microsoft.com). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry Western blotting using whole-cell protein extracts and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed as previously described.78 Antibodies used were against ERBB2 (Cell Signaling, 2165); Ki67 (Leica Microsystems, NCL-L-Ki67-MM1); LC3B (Novus Biologicals, NB100-2331); BECN1/Beclin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11427); SQSTM1 (p62, Enzo Life Sciences, BML-PW9860); ATG7 (A2856), ACTB/?-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A4527). Cleaved CASP3 IHC was performed by Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Tissue Analytical Services. Densitometry analysis was performed by ImageJ.79 Tumorigenicity assays Orthotopic mammary gland implantation of iMMECs4 and trangenic mouse tumorigenicity studies were performed according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. C57BL/6 Becn1+/? mice were crossed to MMTV-Neu mice [FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu) 202 Mul/J] (The Jackson Laboratory, 002376). To circumvent suppression of ERBB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis by the C57BL/6 background,45 C57BL/6 Becn1+/? mice were backcrossed into the FVB/N background for 10 generations. FVB Becn1+/? mice were subsequently crossed to MMTV-PyMT mice.80 Progeny cohorts of all resultant genotypes were observed for spontaneous mammary tumor formation by weekly palpation. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and subsequent P values (2-tailed logrank test) were generated using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, www.graphpad.com). Cell viability assays Cells were plated in 6-well plates at medium density, so as to ensure nonconfluency after 5 d of vehicle treatment. Media and drugs were changed after 3 d. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion method automated by a Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter). Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was supplied as an aqueous solution at a concentration of 25 mg/mL and it was a generous gift from the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey clinical pharmacy. Chloroquine diphosphate salt was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (C6628). Statistical analysis (2-tailed Student t test) was performed by Excel�s Data Analysis ToolPak. Gene expression analysis For the data shown in Figure 1, gene expression array data from early stage breast cancers published by Wang et al. and by Richardson et al. (which included some normal breast samples) were combined and analyzed.35,36 The data set of Richardson et al., obtained on U133-Plus Affymetrix arrays, was made compatible with that of Wang et al., obtained on Affymetrix U133A arrays, by restricting it to the probe sets of the U133A chip and processing it with the mas5 software available at http://www.bioconductor.org.81 The distance-weighted discrimination method was used for systematic source and batch bias adjustment in the 2 data sets.82 Breast cancers were classified into basal-like cancers (BA), ERBB2-positive, Luminal (LUM), Luminal A (LA) and Luminal B (LB) by robust consensus clustering.83 The average expression of each gene across all samples was normalized to 0. The mean relative expression of probes corresponding to gene of interest in each subtype was calculated and graphed. Statistical analysis (Student t test) was performed by Excel�s Data Analysis ToolPak (Microsoft, www.microsoft.com). For the data shown in Figure 9, 4 reported breast cancer data sets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): de Cremoux et al.54 (226 breast tumors, Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array, GEO series GSE26639), Hatzis et al.56 (508 ERBB2+ breast tumors, Affymetrix U133A Array, GEO series GSE25066), Servant et al.57 (343 breast tumors, Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression bead chip Array, GEO series GSE30682) and Sabatier et al.55 (266 breast tumors, Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays, GEO series GSE21653). All the Affymetrix data sets were processed using the justRMA function in R Bioconductor, obtaining a log2 expression values. For the Servant et al. data set assayed with an Illumina array, log2 of the reported variance stabilized expression values were used.57 The samples were classified into ERBB2-positive (ERBB2+) or ERBB2-negative (ERBB2?) based on the reported ERBB2 amplification status. The samples were classified into BECN1-high (Beclin+) or BECN1-low (Beclin?) depending on whether BECN1 expression (probe 208945_s_at) was above or below the mean across samples. Gene expression signatures were analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,84 obtaining a quantification of the statistical significance for upregulation (P+) or downregulation (P?) for each signature and sample pair. A sample was said to have a signature significantly upregulated if P+ < 0.05, significantly downregulated if P? < 0.05, and no significant change otherwise. The complete lists of gene signatures are listed in Figure S3. Statistical analysis is listed in Figure S4.

Breast_Cancer " The additional chemotherapy benefit when added to hormonal therapy compared to hormones alone was large in the high-risk group, and minimal in the low-risk group. The benefit in the intermediate group was unclear [14]. The protocol of TAILORx (Trial Assigning Individualised Options for Treatment) has assigned different definitions to risk categories, with �low risk� defined as scores less than 10, high-risk greater than 26 and intermediate between 11 and 25, inclusive. This new �intermediate-risk� group is randomised to receive either hormonal therapy alone or combination chemotherapy and hormonal therapy [15,16]. This trial will hopefully increase our understanding of the utility of adjuvant systemic therapy in this group. TAILORx recruitment in Ireland was run through the All Ireland Cooperative Research Oncology Group (ICORG), and interested and participating oncologists were provided with information and educational materials at ICORG meetings, by post and online. The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides health and personal social services for every Irish resident, using taxation accrued public funds. A substantial proportion of the Irish population also avails of private health insurance from a variety of insurance brokers. Ireland was among the first European countries to publicly reimburse the Oncotype DX test from October 2011. Prior to this date, Oncotype DX had been available for use in this patient cohort in Ireland on trial basis only, as part of the TAILORx trial [16]. From October 2011, Oncotype DX was used in all eligible patients as per national Irish Society of Medical Oncology and National Cancer Control Program guidelines [17]. Recruitment for this trial began in our institution in September 2007 and continued until May 2010. Between May 2010 and October 2011, Oncotype DX was included in only a small proportion (20%) of private health insurance policies, and was not publicly available. The test was therefore not routinely used in clinical practice. 2 Aims This study aims to document longitudinal changes in the uptake of genomic profiling technologies and systemic chemotherapy, and to assess the impact of new evidence on local protocol. 3 Methods A retrospective cohort study was undertaken. Patients were included if their disease fulfilled the following criteria: unilateral, stage T1 or T2, between 10 and 50 mm in size, node-negative, (O)Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive and Her2/neu negative. The study group comprised 471 consecutive female patients diagnosed between January 2006 and May 2013. Patient demographic and tumour clinico-pathological data, Oncotype DX recurrence scores and information regarding chemotherapy treatment regimes, complications and patient outcomes were obtained by chart review. Oncotype DX testing was performed centrally at the Genomic Health Laboratory, using paraffin-embedded tissue samples taken from the tumour. All tumour specimens were analysed in-house in the department of pathology, and interpretation validated by a dedicated breast pathologist. All reports were discussed at a weekly monthly disciplinary meeting. Tumour grade was scored using Elston�Ellis modification of the Scarff�Bloom�Richardson grading system (Nottingham grading system) [18], based on assessment of tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic count. Tumours were staged as per TNM staging system [19]. The use of chemotherapy in patients enrolled to the TAILORx clinical trial was based on recurrence score and randomisation as per protocol. The use of chemotherapy in patients managed outside this trial was guided by recurrence score and decided based on a case-by-case discussion at the multidisciplinary meeting, and in full consultation with patients. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy, and in the case of breast conserving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy. The standard chemotherapy regime consisted of Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide or Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. A comparative analysis was carried out across four time intervals:1.Period prior to availability of Oncotype DX in Ireland (2006�September 2007).2.Period during TAILORx recruitment (September 2007�May 2010).3.Period following TAILORx recruitment and prior to public reimbursement (May 2010�October 2011).4.Period in which Oncotype DX testing is part of routine clinical practice (October 2011�May 2013). All data were analysed using SPSS version 20. 4 Results 4.1 Patient demographics Criteria for inclusion in this study included a diagnosis of unilateral, stage T1 or T2 tumours (?50 mm in maximum diameter), node-negative, ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Three patients had tumours less than 1 cm and were excluded from analysis. Five hundred consecutive female patients were diagnosed with tumours fitting this molecular profile over the study period. Twenty-five of these patients were excluded from analysis in the case of bilateral disease, ipsilateral concomitant second tumour of different morphology or if the diagnosis pertained to a disease recurrence. Two patients had multifocal disease but overall tumour burden measured <50 mm maximally. A total of four hundred and seventy-three tumours in four-hundred and seventy-one patients were then included in the final analysis. Patient and tumour clinico-pathological data are outlined in Table 1. The majority of patients were aged between 50 and 65 years (n = 250, 53%). 4.2 Time intervals The use of Oncotype DX testing and adjuvant chemotherapy across four intervals is outlined in Table 2. The application of the test in clinical practice has increased exponentially since it has been available for use in the public sector. Eighty-five percent of patients (n = 125) managed in the most recent interval underwent genomic profiling of their tumours as part of their treatment. The use of chemotherapy has undergone a stepwise reduction over the four intervals, having been used in 63% of cases in the interval pre-Oncotype DX availability, compared to 32% of cases in the interval of routine Oncotype DX testing. 4.3 Chemotherapy drug costs Chemotherapy drug-related costs reduced dramatically in 2010 following the expiration of the patent on Docetaxel. The cost in our institution of four cycles of the TC (Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide) fell from �5965 in 2006 to �483 in 2013. 4.4 Recurrence scores A total of 240 (51%) Oncotype DX genomic tests were performed over the study period. Of these, 96 were performed as part of the TAILORx trial. Patients were stratified into low-, moderate- and high-risk groups based on recurrence scores, as per the definitions outlined by Paik et al. [14,20]. The majority of patients (n = 118, 50%) had a low recurrence score. A minority (n = 16, 7%) had a score in excess of 31 (high-risk). The remaining patients (n = 100, 43%) were of intermediate risk. All patients with a high-risk score received adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 16, 100%). Of patients with a low-risk score, 16 received chemotherapy (n = 16, 14%). All 16 patients were enrolled to the TAILORx trial, and had a recurrence score in excess of 11, and were randomised to chemotherapy as per protocol [16]. Sixty-five (65%) of patients deemed to be of intermediate recurrence risk were prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in this risk category were far more likely to receive chemotherapy if they were not being managed as part of the TAILORx trial (40 (70%)-versus-25 (58%)) (Table 3). 4.5 Chemotherapy use Univariate analyses were performed to investigate which factors influenced use of chemotherapy (Table 4). Chemotherapy was more often prescribed in the case of tumours of increasing grade (<0.001, X2), increasing size (p = 0.012, Mann�Whitney) and increasing recurrence score (p < 0.001, Mann�Whitney). The use of chemotherapy correlated inversely with age at diagnosis (p < 0.001, Mann�Whitney). Chemotherapy use was also significantly influenced by the time period during which patients were treated (p < 0.001, X2). Four patients declined chemotherapy. Three of these patients did not undergo genomic assessment, and the other patient had an intermediate risk score and was not on a clinical trial. One other patient withdrew from participation in a clinical trial and did not have systemic chemotherapy treatment. These factors were then included in a multivariate model (binary logistic regression, Table 5). Considering traditional prognostic indicators such as grade and tumour size, as well as patient age and interval of treatment, all factors retained significance in influencing decision-making as regards prescription of chemotherapy. However, when recurrence score was included in the multivariate model (Table 6), the traditional prognostic indicators (grade and tumour size) were not shown to be independent factors in guiding chemotherapy use. Patients were 1.32-times more likely to receive chemotherapy with each unit increase in recurrence score (p < 0.001). The interval during which patients underwent treatment remained a significant predictive factor (p = 0.04). In those patients in whom Oncotype DX was not used, traditional prognostic factors such as grade, size and age were highly significant in determining chemotherapy use (Table 8). In this cohort, time interval of treatment was also found to impact on decision-making (p = 0.045), with patients managed following the introduction of Oncotype DX into clinical practice being far less likely to receive chemotherapy than those patients managed in the era pre-Oncotype DX availability (OR 0.09, p = 0.008), despite a lack of formal tumour genomic assessment. 4.6 Follow up and disease recurrence The median follow up in this series is 47 months (8�97). Over the study period, 12 (2.5%) patients experienced disease progression, relapse or a second cancer. Two patients progressed to develop visceral metastases, and one patient unfortunately succumbed to metastatic disease of bone, brain and viscera. Five patients (1%) developed metastases limited to bone. Three patients developed recurrent disease despite having received full dose chemotherapy. One patient had a recurrence score of 36 and developed visceral metastases despite receiving full dose chemotherapy. The five patients in whom bone metastases were diagnosed had received hormonal agents only. A further four patients developed contralateral breast disease. One patient was diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer of different morphology, while three patients developed contralateral breast disease of similar morphology. 5 Discussion It is well reported that variations in gene expression patterns can influence breast cancer phenotype, and clustering of gene expression patterns can be used to these tumours into distinct molecular subgroups [3]. It is recognised that each tumour has a unique gene expression profile, and there may be diversity in tumour biology and disease progression even between tumours of the same molecular subtype [21]. These variations can greatly influence intrinsic tumour behaviour, and, therefore, response to treatment and patient outcome. Traditionally, the need for chemotherapy was decided based on tumour clinico-pathological prognostic indicators, with factors such as age [22], tumour size, nodal status, grade and receptor expression profiles taken into consideration as predictors of recurrence risk [23,24]. Generally, tumours <2 cm of grade 1 would not be managed on endocrine therapy alone. Those patients however, if recruited to TAILORx, underwent genomic profiling and were randomised to treatment groups according to protocol. Some traditional prognostic factors may reflect timing of cancer detection as opposed to tumour biology [25], and may therefore miss some of the patients that would accrue most survival benefit from systemic therapy, leading to potentially inappropriate under-treatment [8]. Furthermore, these traditional prognostic indicators lack specificity, resulting in over-treatment of patients with potentially harmful adjuncts of negligible benefit beyond local curative resection, radiation and systemic endocrine therapy [12]. The Oncotype DX 21-gene assay represents the first clinically validated multi-gene assay that can quantify the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence [8]. The recurrence score generated in this test has been consistently shown to directly impact decision-making in breast cancer management [25,26]. Treatment decisions among medical oncologists for early breast cancer are variable even with the use of gene assays [27,28]. A pooled analysis by Carlson and Roth [12] found the proportion of patients with low-risk recurrence scores receiving chemotherapy to range between 0 and 16% across fourteen series (pooled mean 5.8%). In our series, 14% (n = 16) of patients in this category received chemotherapy. It is worth noting that all 16 of these patients were enrolled in the TAILORx trial. These patients all had recurrence scores greater than 11, necessitating their inclusion in the trial arm. They were then randomised to receive chemotherapy. Patients not enrolled to TAILORx were spared chemotherapy in all cases of a low-risk recurrence score. All patients with a high-risk recurrence score (n = 16, 100%) received chemotherapy whether or not they were enrolled to a clinical trial. In other series this proportion ranged between 72% and 100% (pooled mean 83.4%) [12]. Patients found to have an intermediate-risk recurrence score (18�30) received chemotherapy in 65% cases. Patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy if they were not enrolled to TAILORx (n = 40 (70%)-versus-25 (58%)). This proportion is higher than that reported in other series (range 23.9�65% [12]). When considering factors influencing chemotherapy prescribing in this group alone (Table 7), the absolute Oncotype score was significant in influencing use of chemotherapy (OR 1.28 per unit increase). TAILORx participation was not shown to be an independent predictor of chemotherapy use when considering other factors such as Oncotype score, age at diagnosis and tumour size and grade. Grade was found to retain strong significance in this group, with tumours of grade 2 and grade 3 associated with a 13.8- and 12.1-fold increased used of chemotherapy compared to tumours of low grade even when all other factors were considered (p = 0.016). This reflects a reversion back to traditional prognostic indicators in the decision-making process when faced with an indeterminate score. The most striking finding of this series was the observed stepwise reduction in chemotherapy use. Considering time intervals alone, this is unexpected, given that the cost of systemic therapy has decreased drastically over the study period and yet is being utilised less frequently. The application of Oncotype DX has previously been shown to influence decision-making in chemotherapy-prescribing [29]. In this series, we have shown the introduction of the 21-gene assay into the clinical arena to have an influence on decision-making among disciplinary teams independent of its direct use. The concept that not all patients might benefit from chemotherapy by virtue of favourable tumour genomics has translated into reduced application of systemic therapy even in those patients in whom formal genomic appraisal was not available. Traditional prognostic factors are now only relied on in the case of an indeterminate result. Validation of the Oncotype DX by level one evidence [30] has led to a change in physician attitudes towards risk stratification and adjuvant chemotherapy use. 6 Conclusion The application of Oncotype DX has been successfully integrated into the treatment paradigm of patients with early stage ER+, node-negative breast cancer in our institution. Patients at lowest risk of disease recurrence on the basis of the test have been spared chemotherapy, while those found to be likely to receive most survival benefit from chemotherapy have all received systemic treatment. Traditional prognostic factors remain important in decision-making in patients of indeterminate scores. The introduction of Oncotype DX testing into clinical practice in our institution has led to reduction in the application of systemic therapy independent of its actual use. Long-term data regarding patient outcome are awaited but certainly short- and medium-term results are favourable. This illustrates the importance of continued adaptation of the clinical team to new evidence in decision-making of breast cancer management. Conflict of interest statement None declared.

All rights reserved. 2014 OBJECTIVES Somatosensory amplification is the experience of sensing everyday bodily sensations as intense, agitating, and unpleasant. Using data from menopausal breast cancer survivors and midlife women without cancer, the study purposes were to (1) explore the psychometric properties of the Somatosensory Amplification Scale and (2) to describe somatosensory amplification and its relationship to menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, mood and sleep disturbance. STUDY DESIGN This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study using demographic, e-diary, and questionnaire data from 99 breast cancer survivors and 138 midlife women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Somatosensory amplification, hot flashes (frequency, severity, bother, interference, perceived control), mood, and sleep. RESULTS Cronbach�s alphas for the scale were low. When an 8-item version of the scale was evaluated, alphas improved and item-total correlations remained strong or improved. Midlife women and breast cancer survivors did not have significantly different somatosensory amplification total or item scores after adjusting for group differences in demographics. Somatosensory amplification was significantly correlated with hot flash interference, perceived control over hot flashes, and mood and sleep disturbance in both groups but the patterns of correlations differed slightly between groups and depending on whether the 10-item or 8-item scale was used. CONCLUSION Somatosensory amplification may be a relevant concept to assess in relation to the menopausal symptom experience of midlife women with and without breast cancer as it may represent a potential intervention target to improve the menopausal symptom experience.

Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from multivesicular bodies and are released by all cell types. They contain proteins, lipids, microRNAs, mRNAs and DNA fragments, which act as mediators of intercellular communications by inducing phenotypic changes in recipient cells. Tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to play critical roles in different stages of tumor development and metastasis of almost all types of cancer. One of the ways by which exosomes affect tumorigenesis is to manipulate the tumor microenvironments to create tumor permissive �niches�. Whether breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate epithelial cells of the mammary duct to facilitate tumor development is not known. To address whether and how breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate ductal epithelial cells we studied the interactions between exosomes isolated from conditioned media of 3 different breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7), representing three different types of breast carcinomas, and normal human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Our studies show that exosomes released by breast cancer cell lines are taken up by HMECs, resulting in the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy."
Breast_Cancer "Inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) led to abrogation of autophagy. HMEC-exosome interactions also induced the phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX and Chk1 indicating the induction of DNA damage repair (DDR) responses. Under these conditions, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 was also observed. Both DDR responses and phosphorylation of p53 induced by HMEC-exosome interactions were also inhibited by NAC. Furthermore, exosome induced autophagic HMECs were found to release breast cancer cell growth promoting factors. Taken together, our results suggest novel mechanisms by which breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate HMECs to create a tumor permissive microenvironment. This work was supported by H. M.

Introduction Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Approximately, 1 out of every 8 women is expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime [1]. In spite of great strides made in diagnosis for breast cancer in the last decade, treatment options remain limited particularly since little is known about how primary breast tumors develop in the mammary ducts and how the primary tumor subsequently progresses as an invasive and metastatic disease [2], [3]. Recent data suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in disease initiation and its progress [4]�[8]. The TME is composed of several cell types depending on the stage of tumor development. During the initial stages of tumor development and in the case of tumors in situ, TME is largely composed of ductal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, while in the later stages of tumor progression, namely, during invasive disease, TME is composed of several cell-types such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mammary epithelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells [5],[7],[9]. Several recent studies have indicated that cancer associated fibroblasts and immune cells present in the TME communicate with breast cancer cells to facilitate tumorigenesis [6], [10]�[13]. While it has been shown that the nature of intercellular communications or �cross talk� between TME and breast cancer cells affects how the tumor responds to anti-cancer therapeutics [14]�[16], precise mechanisms of intercellular communications are still not clearly understood. More specifically, completely unknown is the �cross talk� mechanism between the breast cancer cells and the normal epithelial cells of the mammary duct during tumor development and progression. Cancer cells and TME are known to communicate with each other not only via direct contact (by adhesion factors) but also by secreted paracrine factors (released factors) such as secreted proteins (cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors), nucleic acids and extracellular vesicles (EVs) [8],[17],[18]. Among the released factors, EVs represent a new paradigm of intercellular communications [18]. EVs have a size range of 50 to 1000 nm and are further categorized into microvesicles/apoptotic bodies, membrane particles, exosome like vesicles and exosomes based on their size, origin and molecular composition [19]. Exosomes are multivesicular body-derived vesicles of 50 to100 nm in diameter and were first described as such by Johnstone et al., in 1987 [20]. These vesicles contain a wide range of functional proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs and are actively secreted via exocytosis from almost all cell types including dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and tumor cells [21], [22]. Exosomes are found in almost all physiological fluids including urine, plasma, saliva, semen and breast milk since their small size allows them to travel freely across tissue spaces and in the circulatory system [23]�[25]. Furthermore, since exosomes bear the molecular signatures of the cell of origin, they have been widely studied for the development of biomarkers [26], [27]. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes may act as mediators of intercellular communications affecting various physiological and pathophysiological processes [28]�[30]. Intercellular communications mediated by exosomes are primarily achieved via either one or multiple mechanisms of exosome-target cell interactions. Exosomes have been shown to interact with target cells by specific receptor-ligand engagements sometimes leading to their uptake by target cells while simultaneously triggering specific intracellular signal cascades (i.e., via juxtacrine signaling), which often leads to alterations of gene expression in these target cells [31], [32]. Other mechanisms of exosome-target cell interactions include their uptake either by phagocytosis or fusion of exosomal membranes with target cell plasma membranes [33]�[35]. Regardless of the involved mechanisms, exosomal cargo has been shown to be delivered into cytosolic compartments and often also ends up in the nuclei of target cells [36]. In the context of tumor development, exosome-mediated signaling has been shown to promote tumor progression through communications between the tumor and its surrounding stroma [37], activation of proliferative and angiogenic pathways [38], initiation of premetastatic sites [39], [40], and suppression of the immune-surveillance machinery [41]. In breast cancers, tumor secreted exosomes have been shown to facilitate tumor progression and metastasis by affecting cancer cell adhesion and spreading [42], transfer of phenotypic traits to secondary cells [43], converting adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells into myofibroblast like cells [44], and by inhibiting differentiation of bone marrow dendritic cells [45]. In addition to tumor secreted exosomes, those secreted by normal cells of the TME have also been shown to facilitate tumor development and metastasis by acting upon the breast cancer cells [46], [47]. However, completely unknown are the effects of breast cancer cell secreted exosomes on the normal mammary epithelial cells which are one of the key members of the ductal microenvironment and are also found in TME of invasive disease. In this study, we determined how breast cancer cell released exosomes manipulate human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) to facilitate tumor growth. We show that exosomes released from breast cancer cells are taken up by HMECs and exosome-HMEC interactions results in ROS production. ROS induces autophagy, DNA damage response (DDR), phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and stabilization of p53 in HMECs. Treatment of HMECs with the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) not only abrogates ROS production during exosome-HMEC interaction, but also abrogates autophagy, DDR and phosphorylation of p53. Functionally, we show that spent culture media from exosome induced autophagic HMECs can stimulate growth of different breast cancer cell lines, indicating the release of tumor promoting factors by autophagic HMECs. Materials and Methods Cells Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 [48] and MCF7 [49] were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS and MEM non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies). T47DA18 breast cancer cells [50], were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM non-essential amino acids and recombinant human insulin (Life Technologies). Media used for all cell lines were supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Normal human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) derived from normal adult mammary glands (Cell Applications, San Diego, CA) were grown in epithelial cell culture media with growth factors (Cell Applications) HMECs were obtained as passage 5, cells between passage 6�9 were used in this study. All cultures were maintained at 37�C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Antibodies and reagents Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human LC3 A/B were from Serotech, Hercules, CA. Rabbit antibodies against human phospho-p53 (S9, S15, S46 and S392, respectively), p53, phospho-histone H2AX (?H2AX) (Serine 139), H2AX phospho-ATM (S1981), ATM, phospho-Chk1 (S345), Chk1, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human Alix were from Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human phospho-histone H2AX (Serine 139) for immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was from Chemicon/Millipore Billerica, MA. Rabbit and mouse anti-human Tsg101 antibodies were from Abcam, Cambridge, MA. Mouse anti-actin and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies linked to HRP, Alexa Flour 488, Alexa Flour 350, Alexa Flour 594, Alexa Flour 647 and SlowFade (with or without DAPI) were from Life Technologies. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies linked to IRDye 700 or IRDye 800 were from LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was from Sigma. Exosome isolation Exosomes were isolated from cell conditioned media by ultracentrifugation (Fig. S1) [51]. Briefly, cells grown in complete media were trypsinized, washed in PBS extensively and seeded in exosome depleted cell culture media for collecting exosomes. Complete cell culture media containing 20% FBS was centrifuged for 16 h at 100,000�g, supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 �m sterile filter and subsequently mixed with serum free media to prepare exosome depleted cell culture media containing 10% FBS. Cells were grown in exosome depleted culture media up to 70% confluence. Cell culture media was collected and cleared of debris and non-exosome vesicles by sequential centrifugations (200�g for 10 min, 2000�g for 20 min, 10000�g for 30 min) and then centrifuged at 100,000�g for 70 min to pellet exosomes. The exosome pellet was washed 2 times with calcium and magnesium free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 100,000�g for 70 min and resuspended in 200 �l PBS. To study uptake of breast cancer cell released exosomes by normal primary cells, exosomes were labeled with fluorescent dye PKH-67 using the PKH-67 labeling kit (Sigma) [52]. Briefly, 100 �g protein equivalents of exosomes were resuspended in 100 �l PBS and mixed with 100 �l of PHK67 dye diluted in diluent C (1?1 v/v) for 5 min. This mixture was diluted with 4.5 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 100,000�g for 70 min to pellet the PKH-67 labeled exosomes. The exosome pellet was further washed twice with PBS by ultracentrifugation at 100,000�g for 70 min, to remove any free dye and finally the exosome pellet was resuspended in 100 �l PBS and used for uptake studies. Electron microscopy Exosomes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy using negative staining. 2.5 �l of purified exosomes was adsorbed onto Formvar/carbon coated copper mesh grids, washed with PBS, and stained with freshly prepared 2.0% phosphotungstic acid in aqueous suspension. Samples were imaged using a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) equipped with a LaB6 cathode and operated at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Images were taken using a Hamamatsu ORCA- HR CCD (AMT, Massachusetts, US). Flow cytometry Aliquots of 105 target cells in 500 �l serum free media were incubated with 10 �g PKH-67 labeled exosomes for varying time periods at 37�C, washed twice in ice cold PBS, trypsinized, washed by centrifugation at 250�g for 5 min and analyzed by a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD biosciences) using FACS DIVA and Flow Jo software for the uptake of exosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) Cells were grown to semi-confluence in 8- well chamber slides and incubated with exosomes for up to 24 h. Cells were washed extensively with PBS, then fixed and permeabilized using Cytoperm-Cytofix (BD Biosciences) at 4�C for 30 min. For immunostaining, cells were washed using Permwash buffer (BD Biosciences), blocked using 5% normal donkey serum or 5% BSA and sequentially incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, first with primary antibodies and then with secondary antibodies in Permwash buffer. Nuclei were stained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and slides were viewed under epifluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i). Images were captured using a CCD camera and analyzed using Metamorph software. Effects of exosome-HMEC interactions 105 HMECs were seeded per well of 6 well plates in epithelial cell complete media for 16 h. Semi-confluent layers of cells were then washed extensively with PBS and epithelial cell basal media (without growth factors) was added to the wells and cells were incubated at 37�C under 5% CO2 for 2 h. After incubation, the media was withdrawn and replaced with epithelial cell basal media either containing 10 �g protein equivalents of exosomes per ml, or without it. Cells were further incubated for up to 24 h and processed for further studies as required. Breast cancer cell culture in conditioned media from exosome treated HMECs Spent culture media from HMECs treated with exosomes for 24 h or untreated, as described in the preceding section was collected, passed through a 0.22 �m filter and used for culturing breast cancer cells. Cancer cells grown in complete media were trypsinized, washed extensively with PBS and seeded in conditioned media from HMEC cultures. Cell density was calculated 24 h later following trypsinization and counting of cells using a haemocytometer. Western blot Cells and exosomes were lysed in non-denaturing cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCL pH 8, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by sonication on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000�g, for 30 min at 4�C and supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% skim milk and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Species specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), IRDye 700 or IRDye 800 were used for detection. Immunoreactive bands detected using HRP conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using enhanced Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Bands were further scanned and quantitated using the Alpha-Imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leonardo, CA) imaging system. Bands detected using IRDye conjugated antibodies were visualized and analyzed using an Odyssey scanner from LI-COR. Protein estimation in lysates was carried out using the BCA protein assay kit, Pierce. ROS measurement HMECs were cultured in a 96-well plate until they were semi-confluent (70% confluent) and were incubated with epithelial cell basal media without growth factors for 2 h. Cells were loaded with dye by replacing the basal medium with fresh basal media containing 10 �M cell permeant 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2?,7?-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA [C6827]; Life Technologies) and with or without 10 �g/ml exosomes for up to 3 h at 37�C under 5% CO2. Fluorescence was measured using a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) with a 485/20 excitation, 528/20 emission filter pair and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) sensitivity setting of 50. Between each two time points, the cells were kept in the culture incubator. For measurement of ROS in the presence of NAC, cells were treated with 1 �M NAC for 1 hr in epithelial cell basal media, washed and incubated with exosomes in the presence of NAC and ROS detector CMH2DCFDA and processed as described above. Statistical analysis All experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Histograms represent the mean values, and bars indicate standard error of the mean. The statistical significance of the results was determined using Student's t-test and Anova. The data was considered significant when p<0.05. Results Exosomes secreted by breast cancer cells are taken up by normal human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) To study the effects of breast cancer cell secreted exosomes on normal mammary epithelial cells, we isolated exosomes from conditioned media of 3 different breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7) using multi-step centrifugation (Fig. S1) [51]. These cell lines were chosen to represent three different types of breast cancers, viz., MDA-MB-231, triple negative and highly aggressive metastatic adenocarcinoma [48]; T47DA18, estrogen receptor positive and invasive ductal carcinoma [50]; MCF7, estrogen receptor positive but non-aggressive metastatic adenocarcinoma [49]. "
Breast_Cancer "Exosome yields from multiple independent batches of cell cultures were estimated by assessing the total protein content using BCA methods. In our experiments, for all 3 different cancer cell lines, we routinely isolated approximately 200 �g protein equivalent of exosomes from 240 ml of conditioned media collected from cultures of 45�106 cells. We assessed the purity of isolated exosomes using western blotting to detect the presence of well known exosome marker proteins, Alix [51] and CD63 [51] as well as the absence of calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein that is often associated with cell debris [51]. As expected, calnexin was only detected in total cellular lysates and not in exosomes (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 3 and 5 vs. lanes 2, 4 and 6), indicating that our exosome preparations are free of cellular components and debris. Furthermore, both Alix and CD63 were detected in exosomes derived from all 3 different cancer cell lines (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 4 and 6). We also observed that while CD63 was present in both cellular lysates and exosomes for all the cell types, Alix was not significantly detectable in lysates of T47DA18 and MCF7 cells when compared to the MDA-MB-231 cell lysates. One possible explanation might be differences in expression levels of this protein among different cell lines coupled with the fact that Alix is enriched in exosome fractions; however, further in depth studies are necessary to completely explain this observation. Nonetheless, the presence of both exosomal markers and absence of calnexin verifies the purity of our exosome preparations. 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g001 Figure 1 Characterization of exosomes secreted by breast cancer cells and exosome uptake by HMECs. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media of 3 different breast cancer cell lines, T47DA18, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 and characterized by (A) detection of exosome specific proteins by western blotting and (B) electron microscopy. (A) Western blotting for endoplasmic reticulum specific protein calnexin and exosome marker proteins Alix and CD63 in total cellular lysates (lanes 1, 3 and 5) and exosome preparations (2, 4 and 6). 10 �g of protein was analyzed for each sample. (B) Characterization of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Exosomes isolated by multi-step centrifugation were fixed, negatively stained using phosphotungstic acid and observed by TEM. (C) Exosomes isolated from conditioned media of MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with fluorescent dye PHK67. 10 �g protein equivalent of labeled exosomes were incubated with 5�104 HMECs for 24 h. HMECs were washed extensively with PBS, fixed in PFA and observed using an epifluorescence microscope. Green fluorescent �specs� represent PKH-67 labeled exosomes taken up by the HMECs. (D) Flow cytometric analysis of HMECs exposed to PKH-67 labeled exosomes as described in (C). We further confirmed this by analyzing exosomes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Representative TEM image of exosomes isolated from conditioned media of MDA-MB-231 cells as shown in Fig. 1 B demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous population of cup-shaped ?100 nm exosome vesicles. Similar vesicles were also observed in preparations from conditioned media of both T47DA18 and MCF7 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings confirm the presence and purity of breast cancer cell secreted exosomes in our preparations. To determine the exosome-HMEC interactions, we first assessed the uptake of breast cancer cell secreted exosomes by HMECs. To track exosome uptake, we labeled exosomes with a green fluorescent dye PKH-67 [52] and incubated sub-confluent layers of HMECs with PKH-67 labeled exosomes for up to 24 h. Uptake of exosomes by HMECs was assessed using fluorescence microscopy after extensively washing the cells to remove any extracellular exosomes. A representative image of HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231cells shown in Fig. 1 C demonstrates the uptake of exosomes by HMECs. Similar results were also observed for exosomes from T47DA18 and MCF7 cells (data not shown). In all cases we observed >90% of HMECs containing green fluorescent exosomes. We further confirmed this quantitatively, using flow cytometry to analyze uptake of PKH-67 labeled exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells by HMECs (Fig. 1D). Although we did not study in depth the intracellular localization of these exosomes in the HMECs, preliminary data using LysoTracker to stain lysosomes [53] indicated some colocalization, suggesting that some of the exosomes were in lysosomal compartments of HMECs after their uptake (data not shown). Exosome-HMEC interactions induce ROS production in HMECs Recently, the role of ROS induced autophagy in TME has been underscored by the proposal of an autophagic breast tumor stroma model that has been shown to play an important role in facilitating tumor growth and metastasis [54]. According to this new paradigm, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in cancer associated stromal cells [54]. Oxidative stress leads to induction of autophagy and senescence in stromal cells which results in the production of recycled nutrients and metabolites to �fuel� tumor growth [55]. This paradigm is supported by the following observations: (a) autophagy and senescence is noted in fibroblasts co-cultured with breast cancer cells [56]; (b) autophagic and senescent fibroblasts secrete L-lactate, ketone bodies and amino acids that serve as �fuels� for cancer cell growth [56]; (c) senescence is observed in cancer associated stromal cells in pathological human breast tumor sections [56], and (d) H2O2 induced senescent fibroblasts promote tumor growth and metastasis in vivo when co-injected with cancer cells in nude mice [57]. However, the precise nature of the signals coming from cancer cells that induces oxidative stress in stromal cells is not clearly understood. We investigated whether interactions and uptake of cancer cell released exosomes by HMECs serve as a signal to induce ROS in the mammary epithelial cells. We assessed the kinetics of ROS production in HMECs incubated with exosomes for up 3 h by fluorimetry using a cell permeable fluorogenic ROS probe CMH2DCFDA [58] (Fig. 2). Compared to the control HMECs alone, we detected significantly higher levels of ROS in HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2, red vs. green lines). Similar observations were noted when exosomes from T47DA18 and MCF7 cells were used (data not shown). 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g002 Figure 2 Detection of ROS production during exosome-HMEC interactions. Semi-confluent layers of 5�104 HMECs were incubated with 10 �g protein equivalent of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells and ROS detection agent 10 �M CMH2DCFDA in a total volume of 300 �l of epithelial cell basal growth media for up to 3 h. Fluorescence of oxidized CMH2DCFDA was assessed fluorimetrically at the indicated time points to detect ROS production during exosome-HMEC interactions. Exosome-HMEC interactions induce autophagy in HMECs Next, we examined the induction of autophagy in HMECs following the uptake of exosomes. During autophagy, the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3; LC3 I) is cleaved and then conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II), which is then recruited to autophagosomal membranes [59]. To assess autophagy, we performed western blotting to detect the presence of autophagic proteins LC3 I and LC3 II [60], and IFA to detect cytoplasmic LC3 positive autophagosomal membranes or �LC3 puncta� [61] in HMECs incubated with exosomes for up to 24 h. While expression of only LC3 I was detectable in total cellular lysates of untreated HMECs, both LC3 I and II were clearly detected in lysates of HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 24 h (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, using IFA, we did not detect any �LC3 puncta� in untreated HMECs and in contrast, numerous cytoplasmic �LC3 puncta� were observed in the HMECs exposed to exosomes from MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 or MCF7 cells, respectively (Fig. 3 B, yellow arrows). Quantitative assessment of �LC3 puncta� positive autophagic cells further showed that while these cells accounts for <5% of untreated HMECs, they are >60% of the population in the case of HMECs exposed to exosomes (Fig. 3 C). It is also interesting to note that we did not observe any significant difference in the number of autophagic cells when HMECs were incubated with exosomes from different types of breast cancer cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g003 Figure 3 Induction of autophagy in HMECs following uptake of breast cancer cell released exosomes. (A) Western blot analysis for detection of proteins LC3 I and II in cellular lysates of untreated HMECs and those incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h. Equal protein concentrations of whole cell lysates were analyzed by western blots. ?- actin was used as an equal loading control. (B) IFA of LC3 �puncta� formation in HMECs untreated or incubated with exosomes from either MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 or MCF7 cells for 24 h.

LC3 expression was detected using donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 594 fluorophore. White arrows indicate LC3 �puncta� characteristic of autophagy. (C) Quantitation of cells with LC3 puncta in cultures incubated with or without exosomes. A minimum of 10 independent fields of view/50 cells were chosen for colocalization analysis. Error bars indicate SEM values.***: p<0.001. Exosome-HMEC interaction induced ROS plays a role in autophagy induction in HMECs To determine whether the ROS induction during exosome-HMEC interactions serves as the �signal� for autophagy induction in HMECs, we used NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), a scavenger of ROS [62], to inhibit ROS production in HMECs during exposure to cancer cell released exosomes. Subsequently, under optimum conditions of NAC treatment, we assessed for autophagy to determine if inhibition of ROS production during exosome-HMEC interactions led to inhibition of autophagy in HMECs. We used 1 �M NAC to inhibit ROS in HMECs as this was the highest concentration of NAC that did not show any cytotoxicity against HMECs when cells were treated for up to 4 h (data not shown). To measure ROS during NAC treatment, we pretreated HMECs with 1 �M NAC for 1 hr, washed and exposed them to exosomes for up to 3 h in the presence or absence of 1 �M NAC. 1 �M NAC treatment inhibited the naturally produced ROS in untreated HMECs (Fig. 4 A, untreated vs. NAC). To compare the kinetics of ROS production, HMECs were pre-treated with 1 �M NAC for 1 h and exposed to exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of 1 �M NAC for up to 3 h. NAC treatment not only significantly inhibited exosome induced ROS production for up to 3 h but also kept ROS levels comparable to background levels observed in untreated HMECs (Fig. 4 A, compare Exosome alone vs. Exosome +NAC vs. untreated). 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g004 Figure 4 Effects of NAC on ROS production, exosome uptake and induction of autophagy during exosome-HMEC interactions. (A) HMECs were treated with or without NAC were incubated with or without exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 3 h. ROS production was detected fluorimetrically using CMH2DCFDA at the indicated times. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of the effects of NAC on uptake of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells. HMECs were incubated with exosomes labeled with PKH-67 dye for different time periods and exosome uptake was assessed by flow cytometry (i). (ii) HMECs were treated with �M NAC for 1 hr and then incubated with PKH-67 labeled exosomes in the presence of NAC for different time periods and analyzed by flow cytometry. (iii) Comparisons of mean fluorescence intensities of HMECs under conditions described in (i) and (ii). (C) Western blot analysis for detection of autophagy protein LC3 I and II in cellular lysates of HMECs that were treated with or without NAC and incubated with or without exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for 3 h. Equal protein concentrations of cellular lysates were analyzed by western blots. ?- actin was used as an equal loading control. Next, we assessed the effect of NAC treatment on exosome uptake during exosome-HMEC interactions. We used 1 �M NAC under conditions as described above for ROS assessments during exosome-HMEC interactions. HMECs were incubated with PKH-67 dye exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, in the presence or absence of NAC for up to 3 h. At different time intervals HMECs were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess uptake of PKH-67 dye labeled exosomes (Fig. 4 B). A progressive increase in the population of HMECs containing PKH-67 positive exosomes was observed in HMECs incubated with exosomes in the absence of NAC (Fig. 4 B, i), indicating an increase in exosome uptake over time. However, in the presence of NAC, the uptake of exosomes by HMECs was observed to be reduced but not completely abrogated (Fig. 4 B, ii and iii). These findings indicate that while NAC treatment does not completely abrogate exosome uptake by HMECs, it results in significant inhibition of ROS production in HMECs. Finally, we assessed LC3 by western blotting to determine if ROS inhibition by NAC under optimal conditions as described in Fig. 4 A (i.e., HMEC+MDA-MB-231 exosomes +1 �M NAC for 3 h) inhibits autophagy in HMECs. ?- actin levels were used as loading control. We detected only LC3 I in untreated HMECs and in HMECs treated with NAC for 3 h (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2). However, while both LC3 I and II were observed in HMECs exposed to exosomes for 3 h in the absence or presence of NAC, LC3 II levels were significantly decreased in the presence of NAC (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 vs. 4). Taken together these findings suggested that interaction of HMECs with exosomes from breast cancer cells induce ROS, which can further result in autophagy induction in these epithelial cells. ROS produced during exosome-HMEC interactions results in induction of DNA damage response (DDR) ROS induced oxidative stress is known to induce DDR [63] in cells which can lead to both phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, resulting in stabilization of p53 [64]. Moreover, stabilization of p53 can lead to either apoptosis or autophagy and senescence via cell cycle arrest [65], [66]. To determine the possible mechanism by which ROS, produced during exosome-HMEC interactions can induce autophagy, we assessed the induction of DDR. HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 3vh were analyzed by western blotting to detect the phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX (?H2AX), and Chk1, 3 key members of the DDR pathway [67] (Fig. 5 A). Compared to the levels in untreated HMECs, levels of phospho ATM, H2AX and Chk1 increased significantly with the increase in time of incubation of HMECs with exosomes (Fig. 5 A). Total levels of ATM, H2AX, and Chk1 did not show any significant change during this period. These findings clearly indicated that exosome-HMEC interactions lead to DDR induction. 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g005 Figure 5 Detection of DNA damage response in HMECs incubated with exosomes and its abrogation by NAC.

Nuclei were stained with DAPI. (C) IFA of phospho ATM in HMECs untreated or incubated with exosomes from either MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7 cells for 24 h.

Nuclei were stained with DAPI. (D) Western blot analysis for expression of phosphorylated H2AX (?H2AX) in HMECs that were untreated, treated with NAC alone, treated with NAC and incubated with exosomes, or left untreated but incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for 3 h. Equal protein concentrations of cellular lysates were analyzed. ?- actin was used as an equal loading control. To further assess whether DDR is induced in HMECs by exosomes from all 3 breast cancer cells, we performed IFA to detect ?H2AX specific micronuclei formation and phospho ATM in HMECs incubated with exosomes for up to 24 h (Fig. 5, B and C). Representative images of IFA for ?H2AX and phospho ATM in the nuclei of untreated HMECs vs. HMECs incubated with exosomes as shown in Fig. 5 B and C, clearly demonstrated that ?H2AX micronuclei and phospho ATM were only detectable in HMECs incubated with exosomes. To further determine whether ROS induced during exosome-HMEC interactions was the signal for induction of DDR, we performed western blots for ?H2AX in untreated HMECs and those treated with or without 1 �M NAC and incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for 3 h (Fig. 5 D). We observed that compared to basal levels of ?H2AX in untreated HMECs, NAC treatment alone did not increase levels of ?H2AX (Fig. 5 D, lanes 1 vs. 2). Moreover, while we detected significantly higher levels of ?H2AX in HMECs incubated with exosomes, only low levels of ?H2AX (comparable to basal levels observed in untreated HMECs) were detected in HMECs treated with NAC and incubated with exosomes (Fig. 5 D, compare lanes 1, 3 and 4). These findings suggest that inhibition of ROS produced during exosome HMEC interaction, by NAC inhibits DDR in HMECs."
Breast_Cancer "ROS produced during exosome-HMEC interactions results in p53 stabilization Phosphorylation of p53 at S15 is well known to stabilize p53 by preventing its proteosomal degradation [68]. To investigate whether p53 is stabilized during exosome- HMEC interactions, we performed western blots to detect the phosphorylation of p53 at the serine 15 residue (pp53 S15) in HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 3 h (Fig. 6 A, top panel). ?-actin levels were used as a loading control. We observed a progressive increase in phosphorylation at S15 during the entire period of exosome-HMEC interaction (Fig. 6 A, top panel). Furthermore, we also observed that total p53 levels significantly increased over time (Fig. 6 A, middle panel) indicating that S15 phosphorylation leads to stabilization of p53 under the above conditions. We also checked the phosphorylation state of the S9, S46 and S392 residues of p53 [69], and did not observe any change indicating that these sites were not affected (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that S15 phosphorylation of p53 (pp53 S15) was sustained until 24 hours post incubation of HMECs with exosomes from all three breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, 47DA18 and MCF7 cells, respectively (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 to 4 vs. lane 1). Lastly, we compared pp53 S15 levels in untreated HMECs vs. those in HMECs treated with or without 1 �M NAC and incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for 3 h (Fig. 6 C). We observed almost complete prevention of S15 phosphorylation of p53 (pp53 S15) in HMECs incubated with exosomes in the presence of NAC in comparison to levels of pp53 S15 noticed in the absence of NAC and in untreated controls (Fig 6 C, lanes 3 vs. 1, 2 and 4). Taken together, our data so far have indicated that exosome induced ROS results in induction of the DDR and stabilization of p53 via phosphorylation at S15 during exosome-HMEC interactions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g006 Figure 6 Detection of phosphorylation of p53 in HMECs incubated with exosomes and its abrogation by NAC. (A) Western blotting for detection of phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (pp53 S15) in HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 3 h.

(B) Western blot analysis for pp53 S15 in cellular lysates of HMECs untreated and those treated with exosomes from 3 different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7 respectively for 24 h. ?- actin was used as an equal loading control.

Exosome-HMEC interactions result in secretion of breast cancer cell growth promoting factors Several recent studies have shown that autophagic breast cancer associated fibroblasts can promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells by releasing growth promoting �metabolites� and amino acids [70]. We investigated whether autophagy induced in HMECs by breast cancer cell released exosomes could also facilitate cancer cell growth. In separated experiments we exposed HMECs to exosomes from either MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells, in HMEC basal media for up to 24 h (optimal conditions that have been observed to induce autophagy in HMECs as shown in Fig. 3). Spent media from HMEC cultures exposed to exosomes were passed through a 0.22 �m sterile filter and tested for its ability to promote growth of the same breast cancer cells (Fig. 7 A). Growth of breast cancer cells (i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, respectively, Fig. 7 B and C, respectively) in spent media from HMEC cultures exposed to exosomes was compared to controls such as (a) conditioned media from exosome untreated HMECs, (b) HMEC basal culture media, and (c) HMEC basal media containing exosomes. We observed that while all control media (as described above) supported growth of cancer cells to a similar extent (up to 2.25 fold increase), only spent media from HMEC cultures exposed to exosomes promoted a significant increase in cancer cell growth by up to ?4�5 fold (Fig. 7 B and C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g007 Figure 7 Effects of conditioned media from HMECs incubated with exosomes on growth of breast cancer cells. (A) Schematics of experimental design. HMECs were untreated or incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells respectively in human epithelial cell basal culture media for 24 h. Spent media from HMEC cultures exposed to exosomes was collected and filtered using a 0.22 �m sterile filter and used as culture media to grow breast cancer cell lines for 24 h as described in materials and methods. (B) Growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in spent media from HMECs incubated with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells and controls, spent culture media from untreated HMECs, HMEC basal growth media and HMEC basal growth media supplemented with exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells. (C) Growth of MCF7 cells in spent culture media from HMECs incubated with exosomes from MCF7 cells and controls, spent culture media from untreated HMECs, HMEC basal growth media and HMEC basal growth media supplemented with exosomes from MCF7 cells. Discussion The findings of our study show that breast cancer cell released exosomes can induce autophagy, DDR and p53 stabilization via ROS production, in HMECs and the autophagic HMECs release breast cancer cell growth promoting factors (Fig. 8). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate that ROS generated during exosome-target cell interactions may be a possible mechanism by which autophagy can be induced in target cells but also underscores the role of autophagic HMECs in promoting tumorigenesis. 10.1371/journal.pone.0097580.g008 Figure 8 Proposed model for breast cancer cell and HMEC crosstalk. Exosomes released from breast cancer cells interact and are taken up by HMECs. Exosome-HMEC interactions induce ROS, which further induces autophagy, phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX and Chk1 (DDR) and stabilization of p53. Inhibition of ROS by NAC abrogates autophagy, DDR and stabilization of p53. Exosome induced autophagic HMECs release breast cancer cell growth promoting factors. In this study we provide evidence that breast cancer cell released exosomes are taken up by HMECs and furthermore report the biological functions mediated by the exosomes. While cancer cell secreted exosomes are largely regarded as a treasure trove for biomarkers [25], [27], the biological functions mediated by these exosomes may represent one of the most intriguing mechanisms by which cancer cells manipulate the tumor microenvironment to create a �niche� for tumorigenesis [71]. Biological functions carried out by breast cancer cell secreted exosomes are relatively unknown in comparison to those in other cancer types. Here we studied some of the biological functions mediated by exosomes secreted by 3 different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7, representing 3 different types of breast cancers [48]�[50]. Interestingly, we observed that all 3 breast cancer cell lines secreted similar amounts of exosomes. However, further clinical studies are necessary to ascertain whether different types and stages of breast cancers secrete similar or different amounts of exosomes and also if there is heterogeneity among the exosomes secreted. Nonetheless, while we did not study the precise mechanism of exosome-HMEC interaction, our studies show that exosomes from different breast cancer cell lines are similarly taken up by HMECs and produced similar phenotypes (e.g. ROS production, autophagy, DDR and p53 stabilzation) in them. However, since exosomes are believed to bear molecular signatures of cells they are secreted from, diversity with respect to the nature of the exosomal cargo in exosomes originating from different types of breast cancer cells can be easily envisioned, this is also predicted to contribute to manifestation of phenotypic differences in HMECs other than those observed by us. Furthermore, while in this study we have focused on HMECs, given the complexity and heterogeneity in the composition of the TME, interactions between cancer cell released exosomes and other cells of TME also needs to addressed. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of biological consequences of interactions between breast cancer exosomes and primary HMECs. Some key findings of our studies (Fig. 8) here include the observed ROS production during exosome HMEC interactions and its role in induction of autophagy in HMECs. The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis has been extensively studied by many groups [54]�[57]. It is perhaps best described as compartment and cell type specific, particularly due to observations such as the �Autophagy Paradox� [55]. While several reports have indicated that autophagy in cancer cells effectively suppress tumorigenesis, recent studies have indicated that autophagy in the TME may promote tumor growth via supply of nutrients and �reverse Warburg effect� [55], [70]. Interestingly, these studies using co-culture systems of breast cancer cell lines and fibroblasts have shown that ROS are generated and induces autophagy in tumor associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, ROS producer H2O2, has been shown to induce autophagy and senescence in TME [57]. While the source of ROS in theTME remains unclear, the observed phenomena is described as the autophagy � senescence transition in TME and has been proposed to explain the link between breast cancer onset and aging [57]. Interestingly, while our studies are in line with others [55], [57] and demonstrate that breast cancer cells are responsible for induction of ROS that induce autophagy in HMECs, we here identify breast cancer cell secreted exosomes as the inducer of ROS in these epithelial cells. Furthermore using NAC to inhibit exosome induced ROS we demonstrate abrogation of ROS induced autophagy. However, additional studies are necessary to delineate the precise mechanism behind ROS production during exosome-HMEC interactions. In attempt to study the possible mechanism by which exosome induced ROS in turn induces autophagy, we assessed the involvement of DDR and p53. ROS is a well characterized inducer of DNA damage and activation of p53 [63], [64]. ROS mediated DNA damage are known to engage double-stranded DNA repair mechanisms (DDR) [67]. These mechanisms include initiation of a signaling cascade involving ATM/ATR, the local deposition of 53BP1/?H2AX (micronuclei foci formation) and modulation of cell cycle regulation by Chk1/2 [67], [72]. ATM is activated via double stranded breaks while ATR responds to single strand damage [67]. ATM/ATR has been shown to phosphorylate p53 at serine 15, which eventually leads to the stabilization and activation of p53 [69]. Continuous activation of p53 leads to induction of autophagy, senescence or apoptosis [73]. We not only observed phosphorylation of H2AX, ATM, Chk1 and p53 at S15 and its stabilization during exosome-HMEC interactions, but interestingly, we also observed that DDR was induced as early as 1 h post incubation of HMECs with exosomes, indicating that ROS production and not uptake of exosomes may be the major signal for this process, since 1 h incubation resulted in only <20% of HMECs containing exosomes. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that abrogation of ROS production during exosome-HMEC interactions by NAC prevented phosphorylation of H2AX and p53. While these observations suggest that these mechanisms may contribute to induction of autophagy, further studies are necessary to establish whether DDR and p53 phosphorylation are linked or mutually independent events induced by ROS. Finally, we demonstrate that only conditioned media from exosome treated HMECs can promote cancer cell growth. Our data clearly indicates that exosomes themselves do not serve as carriers of growth factors for cancer cells since HMEC basal media supplemented with exosomes do not significantly promote cancer cell growth when compared with HMEC basal media alone or conditioned media from HMECs not exposed to cancer cell exosomes. These findings clearly indicate that autophagic HMECs produced by exosome-HMEC interactions secrete cancer cell growth promoting factors. While we did not study whether a �reverse Warburg effect� and nutrient recycling are possible mechanisms involved here, our observations of promoting cancer cell growth by conditioned media from autophagic HMECs are in agreement with those reported by others using in vitro co-culture systems or co-inoculation in animal models of autophagic fibroblasts and breast cancer cells [70]. Conclusions Our studies here not only underscores the functional role of breast cancer secreted exosomes in manipulating the tumor microenvironment to promote cancer cell growth but also establishes the role of normal mammary epithelial cells in tumorigenesis. The significance of exosome mediated manipulation of these epithelial cells are underscored by the fact that not only do these cells make up the mammary ductal microenvironment of the terminal ductal lobular unit which is the origin of most pathologic breast lesions [74], but also because these cells are found in the TME of invasive breast tumors [5], [7]. Further studies to delineate the mechanism of exosome -HMEC interactions and characterization of the exosome induced secretome of these cells are expected to lead to the development of new avenues for prevention and intervention of breast cancer.

Breast_Cancer "ABSTRACT The skeleton is a preferred homing site for breast cancer metastasis. To date, treatment options for patients with bone metastases are mostly palliative and the disease is still incurable. Indeed, key mechanisms involved in breast cancer osteotropism are still only partially understood due to the lack of suitable animal models to mimic metastasis of human tumor cells to a human bone microenvironment. In the presented study, we investigate the use of a human tissue-engineered bone construct to develop a humanized xenograft model of breast cancer-induced bone metastasis in a murine host. Primary human osteoblastic cell-seeded melt electrospun scaffolds in combination with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 were implanted subcutaneously in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. The tissue-engineered constructs led to the formation of a morphologically intact �organ� bone incorporating a high amount of mineralized tissue, live osteocytes and bone marrow spaces. The newly formed bone was largely humanized, as indicated by the incorporation of human bone cells and human-derived matrix proteins. After intracardiac injection, the dissemination of luciferase-expressing human breast cancer cell lines to the humanized bone ossicles was detected by bioluminescent imaging. Histological analysis revealed the presence of metastases with clear osteolysis in the newly formed bone. Thus, human tissue-engineered bone constructs can be applied efficiently as a target tissue for human breast cancer cells injected into the blood circulation and replicate the osteolytic phenotype associated with breast cancer-induced bone lesions. In conclusion, we have developed an appropriate model for investigation of species-specific mechanisms of human breast cancer-related bone metastasis in vivo. KEY WORDS Humanized xenograft model Bone metastasis Breast cancer Osteotropism Tissue engineering Melt electrospinning special-property TIB INTRODUCTIONBone metastasis is one of the most frequent complications of breast cancer (BC), occurring in 80% of patients with advanced disease (Kozlow and Guise, 2005). The preferential homing of circulating cancer cells to the skeleton has been attributed to mechanical factors, such as blood-flow pathways, as well as favorable molecular interactions between the tumor cells and the target bone site (Chambers et al., 2002). For example it has been shown that metastatic cancer cells have the ability to usurp hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homing pathways to reach the bone microenvironment (Kaplan et al., 2005; Psaila and Lyden, 2009; Shiozawa et al., 2011). Skeletal metastases from BC are usually associated with an increased osteoclast activity in response to multiple growth factors and cytokines produced by the cancer cells. In turn, growth factors released from the degradation of the bone matrix further enhance tumor growth (Ooi et al., 2011). Once overt metastases develop, there are only palliative treatment options available to prevent further disease progression and reduce the associated pain and symptoms (Suva et al., 2011).A major obstacle to the development of new therapeutic concepts to prevent or treat bone metastases has been the lack of appropriate in vivo models that replicate the complexity of the human disease. Different xenograft models have been used to generate human cancer metastasis to bone in small animal models, depending on the stage of the disease to be investigated. Direct injection of human cancer cells into the mouse tibia or femur allows consistent development of bone metastases and can replicate tumor-induced changes in murine bone (Le Gall et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008; Ooi et al., 2010). This approach, however, mimics only the final stages of bone colonization by extravasated cancer cells and replicates a primary tumor model rather than a metastasis model. A common method to generate experimental metastasis is the intracardiac injection of osteotropic cancer cells, which quickly induces bone metastases at a high frequency (Yoneda et al., 2001; Henriksen et al., 2002; Yi et al., 2002; Harms et al., 2004; Khalili et al., 2005; Canon et al., 2008). Although these traditionally used xenograft models allow the proliferation of human tumor cells in the mouse skeleton, they are associated with certain limitations. To avoid graft rejection, immune-compromised hosts are necessary, which eliminates the ability to examine the role of the immune system in tumor progression. Moreover, interspecies differences such as incompatibilities in receptor-ligand interactions between the human tumor cells and murine host microenvironment can impair the species-specific pathways occurring during human cancer progression and metastasis (Khanna and Hunter, 2005; Rangarajan and Weinberg, 2003).TRANSLATIONAL IMPACTClinical issueBone metastasis is a life-threatening complication that occurs in 80% of women with advanced breast cancer. The clinical management of patients affected by bone metastases is particularly challenging because early-stage detection is difficult and once overt lesions develop the disease is incurable with currently available treatment options. The development of approaches to prevent or treat bone metastases is hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models to mimic human bone metastatic disease. Traditionally, injection of human cancer cells into mice has been used to investigate bone metastasis but in these models human cancer cells have to disseminate to and grow in murine bone, which does not replicate the physiological tumor-bone interactions that occur in patients. More recently, animal models of human bone metastasis have been developed using subcutaneous implantation of human bone but these models suffer from problems such as donor-related variability and poor viability of the implant.ResultsTissue-engineered systems have the potential to overcome some of the drawbacks of native bone implants and to provide more reproducible and controllable models. In this study, the authors demonstrate that engineered constructs based on biocompatible polymer scaffolds seeded with human bone-forming cells combined with the osteoinductive growth factor bone morphogenetic protein 7 can create a viable ectopic �organ� bone in a mouse model. The newly formed bone microenvironment incorporates human bone cells and human-derived matrix proteins and is therefore humanized. The authors show that human breast cancer cell lines with different affinity for bone metastasize to the human tissue-engineered bone construct (hTEBC) after intracardiac injection. Moreover, the metastases detected in the hTEBC replicate the osteolytic (bone-damaging) phenotype of the bone lesions typically induced by metastasis of breast cancer cells.Implications and future directionsThis study establishes an in vivo model that mimics the metastasis of human breast cancer cells to a human bone-like microenvironment. The new model provides a platform for the dissection of the molecular mechanisms that control the homing to and growth of human breast cancer cells in human bone and for the development of new treatment strategies for bone metastasis. Future improvements of this model such as the incorporation of additional human-derived components (for example, hematopoietic stem cells) into the engineered bone will allow the replication of not only human bone-tumor interactions but also the species-specific interactions that occur between tumor cells and bone marrow stem cells in the metastatic niche.Humanized mice are promising translational models for studying human diseases. To create humanized xenograft models of bone metastasis, human fetal or adult bone pieces have been implanted in the flank of immunodeficient mice to serve as a target site for human cancer cells (Shtivelman and Namikawa, 1995; Nemeth et al., 1999; Yonou et al., 2001; Kuperwasser et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007). This approach represents a great step forward in modeling human bone metastatic disease by allowing the investigation of species- and tissue-specific interactions in a small animal model. However, the use of human bone tissue is associated with practical issues such as availability of tissue, donor-related variability and difficulty in maintaining the functionality and viability of the implant (Holzapfel et al., 2013; Hutmacher et al., 2009). A few recent studies have applied tissue engineering principles to overcome the drawbacks associated with the implantation of native human bone and provide more reproducible, controllable and functional implants (Schuster et al., 2006; Moreau et al., 2007). However, in these models the engineered tissues were not fully characterized from a bone biology point of view. In fact, the histology showed a bone microenvironment with no evident bone marrow and with fibrous tissue filling the spaces between the remaining scaffold structures and the newly deposited mineralized tissue. Moreover, the authors did not demonstrate the human origin of the bone cells and matrix, nor did they show that their models could replicate the osteolytic pattern of bone metastasis.In the presented study, we used primary human osteoblastic cell (hOB)-seeded melt electrospun scaffolds in combination with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7) to promote the development of a viable humanized bone microenvironment in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. The human tissue-engineered bone construct (hTEBC) led to the formation of a mature �organ� bone incorporating human elements. Importantly, the hTEBCs could be applied as a target tissue for the homing of human BC cells injected into the circulatory system. Using this approach, the osteolytic phenotype characteristic of bone metastases from BC could be replicated. We propose that this tissue-engineered platform is a promising tool for elucidating the mechanisms of human BC metastasis to human bone in a murine host.RESULTSReplicating a humanized bone microenvironment in vivo using the hTEBC modelIn vitro characterization of the hTEBCsThe underlying melt electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for the hTEBCs were tubular in shape (10 mm length, 4.7 mm outer and 4 mm inner diameter) and comprised of 30 ?m diameter filaments spaced ~0.5 mm apart (Fig. 1A). Biopsies were taken at different stages of the hTEBC preparation (Fig. 1A) to characterize the scaffold surface properties before and after cell seeding, as well as the morphology and viability of the hOB cells prior to in vivo application. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed the presence of a homogeneous layer of mineralized particles on the scaffold fibers after coating with calcium phosphate (CaP) (Fig. 1B). The pores of the scaffolds were covered by a dense cell layer as shown by SEM (Fig. 1B) after 7 weeks and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) at 2 and 7 weeks post-seeding of the hOBs (Fig. 1C). Live-dead staining indicated that more than 90% of the seeded hOB cells were viable (green) at the time of implantation (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1.In vitro characterization of hTEBCs. (A) Representative images of the melt electrospun PCL scaffolds and schematic showing how biopsies are retrieved for analysis. (B) Characterization of the CaP-coated scaffolds by SEM before cell seeding and after 7 weeks of culture in vitro. (C) Morphology and viability of the hOBs cultured on the scaffolds is assessed by CLSM on cells stained respectively for F-actin (red) and nuclei (blue), or with markers for live (fluorescein diacetate, green) and dead (propidium iodide, red) cells after 2 and 7 weeks of culture in vitro.hTEBCs promote mineralized matrix formationAfter subcutaneous implantation of the hTEBCs in the flanks of NOD/SCID mice, the deposition of mineralized tissue was detected with X-ray imaging in all hTEBCs (Fig. 2A). The implanted scaffolds retained their tubular shape in vivo and bone growth was restricted to the scaffold boundaries (Fig. 2A; supplementary material Fig. S1A). Serial three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of micro-computed tomography (?-CT) data show that mineralization occurred in vitro prior to implantation and progressed over 12 weeks in vivo, with mineralized tissue forming both around and inside the cylindrical construct (Fig. 2A). ?-CT quantification of the mineralized tissue volume (BV), mineralized tissue volumetric density (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the hTEBCs and in endogenous mouse femurs is indicated in Fig. 2A. These results demonstrate the formation of a significantly higher volume of mineralized bone matrix in the hTEBCs compared with mouse femurs (P<0.05). However, BV/TV and BMD were significantly lower (P<0.001) in hTEBCs compared with mouse bones, which correlates with the large cavities filled by soft tissue in the engineered bone (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.Application of the hTEBC to replicate a humanized bone microenvironment. (A) Representative X-ray image at 8 weeks after implantation of the hTEBCs indicates successful bone formation (arrows) in the constructs. Mineralized tissue formation is shown in representative ?-CT reconstructions of hTEBCs prior to implantation (n=4) and 7 (n=4) and 12 weeks (n=10) after implantation. ?-CT quantification of BV, BV/TV and BMD for the hTEBCs (n=10) and mice femurs (n=5).

Other types of tissue that formed in the hTEBCs included cartilage-like tissue, adipose tissue and fibrous connective tissue. Residual PCL scaffold fibers could only be observed in the form of voids left in the tissue. Because the mass loss of PCL scaffolds is negligible in the first 6 months following in vivo implantation (Lam et al., 2009a), the absence of the PCL fibers is due to the processing in xylene solution prior to paraffin embedding and not to degradation of the polymer. The newly formed bone was well vascularized (supplementary material Fig. S1B�D) and viable, as shown by the presence of live osteocytes in the bone lacunae (Fig. 2B). The presence of osteocytes, bone-lining osteoblast-like cells (Fig. 2B) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts (not shown) indicated that the hTEBC model replicates a normal mature bone microenvironment. Bone marrow spaces contained hematopoietic cells, adipocytes and numerous sinusoids (Fig. 2B). The cellular composition of the bone marrow microenvironment included hematopoietic cells of different lineages and differentiation stages such as erythroid and megakaryocytic cells (Fig. 2B; supplementary material Fig. S2), as can be found in the bone marrow in the long bones of mice (Travlos, 2006).Replication of intramembranous and endochondral ossification pathwaysHistological analysis of the hTEBCs showed evidence of bone formation via both the intramembranous and endochondral ossification pathways. The H&E staining revealed the presence of isolated bone spicules surrounded by a cluster of cells or immature fibrous tissue (Fig. 2Ci,ii). These stained negatively for collagen type II using immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 2Cv,vi), thus indicating that the bone formation process occurred without a cartilage intermediary and via intramembranous ossification. However, collagen II-positive cartilage-like structures could be visualized, mainly in the center of the hTEBCs (Fig. 2Ciii,vii). Collagen II-positive tissue was also found surrounded by calcified bone matrix, thus indicating that bone formation in the hTEBCs replicated the different stages of endochondral ossification (Fig. 2Civ,viii). Analysis of H&E staining and cartilage-specific collagen II deposition has been used previously to draw conclusions on the ossification type of tissue-engineered bone (Tortelli et al., 2010).Humanized modelIHC analysis of the hTEBCs with human-specific antibodies was used to determine the species of origin of the cells in the newly formed tissues. A large proportion of the cells in the fibrous and cartilage-like tissue were positive for human nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NuMA) (Fig. 2Dii,iii). In the bone matrix only some of the osteocytes were NuMA-positive (Fig. 2Di), which might be explained by the fact that this marker is usually not expressed in non-proliferating or end-differentiated cells (Sun and Schatten, 2006). However, embedded osteocytes were shown to express the late-stage bone marker osteocalcin stained with a human-specific antibody (Fig. 2Div). Moreover, IHC against human collagen type I and human osteocalcin also demonstrated the presence of human-derived bone matrix proteins in the newly formed bone (Fig. 2Div,v). Positive staining for human collagen I and osteocalcin was located mostly in the center of the scaffolds, whereas the thin cortex-like shell of lamellar bone surrounding the scaffold was negative. Using an antibody specific for human CD146, the presence of single human-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells, as defined by Sacchetti et al. (Sacchetti et al., 2007), was detected in perivascular regions (Fig. 2Dvi) as previously described (Tormin et al., 2011). As expected, staining for hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells and osteoclasts was negative using the human-specific antibodies, indicating that these cells were of murine origin. From these stainings, we conclude that the hTEBCs contained large areas of human bone components, such as human bone cells and human-derived bone matrix, whereas blood vessels and the bone marrow were derived from the host. Sections of mouse femur were used as negative controls to rule out any cross-reactivity of the antibodies with mouse tissue, and human bone sections served as positive controls (supplementary material Fig. S3).hTEBCs are a target site for metastasis by bone-seeking BC cellsAfter having established that a humanized bone microenvironment could be generated in NOD/SCID mice, we set out to test the potential of hTEBCs as target sites for human BC cells. Therefore, the human BC cell line MDA-MB-231, a bone-seeking substrain (MDA-MB-231BO) and a non-metastatic control cell line (MCF10A) were transfected to express luciferase and injected into the left ventricle of the mice heart (Fig. 3A). In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) indicated that the first metastases developed in the host 1 week after intracardiac injection of the BC cells (not shown). However, a precise estimation of the onset of metastases within the hTEBCs was hampered by the fact that the relatively high bioluminescent signals originating from the organs during whole-body live imaging screened the weaker signals from the hTEBCs. Extensive multiorgan metastasis could be detected after 4 weeks in the metastatic cell groups but not in the MCF10A control group (Fig. 3B). Skeletal metastases were seen predominantly in the regions of the jaw, hind limbs and spine. The mice started to manifest signs of hind limb paralysis, difficulty in breathing and cachexia at 4 weeks after intracardiac injection of the BC cells, and the experiment was ended. After sacrifice of the mice, hTEBCs and organs were dissected and imaged ex vivo (Fig. 3C). A high homing rate of the metastatic cell lines to the hTEBCs was observed, with the detection of bioluminescent signal in 85.7% of hTEBCs in 100% of mice for the MDA-MB-231BO cells and 50% of hTEBCs in 71.4% of mice for the MDA-MB-231 group. The average total flux of bioluminescent signal from the bone-seeking MDA-MB-231BO cells was higher than for the parental MDA-MB-231 cells in both hTEBCs and mice hind limbs, but the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). BC cells metastasized less frequently to mice hind limbs compared with hTEBCs, but the average total flux measured in mice hind limbs was higher, although not significantly (P>0.05). Ex vivo analysis also indicated the presence of metastases in the mice hearts, lungs, livers and several other soft tissue organs for the metastatic cell groups. No signal was seen in the hTEBCs or mice organs for the MCF10A control group.Fig. 3.Application of the hTEBC as a target site for BC metastasis. (A) Schematic of the experimental design. (B) Results and representative bioluminescence-photographic overlay images showing metastases to organs and hTEBCs (red circles) detected by in vivo BLI at 4 weeks after intracardiac injection. (C) Tables summarizing metastases detected by ex vivo BLI in the hTEBCs and mice organs. Images of the hTEBCs and representative images from mice organs are shown.The hTEBC model reproduces features characteristic of human BC-related bone metastasisAnalysis by ?CT indicated a lower median BV and BV/TV in the hTEBCs for the metastatic cell groups compared with the control group; however, the differences were not significant (Fig. 4A). Thus, paraffin-embedded samples were serially sectioned and stained with H&E. Histological analysis revealed the presence of micrometastases in the hTEBCs from the metastatic cell groups, where the cancer cells surrounded the newly formed bone and invaded the marrow spaces (Fig. 4B). IHC using an antibody specific for human mitochondria confirmed the human origin of the malignant cells in contact with the newly formed humanized bone (Fig. 4B). The bone surface in contact with the cancer cells displayed an irregular profile, with resorption pits indicating degradation of the matrix by osteoclasts. TRAP staining confirmed the presence of osteoclasts actively degrading the bone (Fig. 4C), thus reflecting the osteolytic character of metastatic BC. TRAP-positive osteoclasts were also detected along the voids left by the scaffold fibers in the presence of the tumor cells (Fig. 4C). Isolated cancer cells were also seen adjacent to voids left by the scaffold fibers (not shown). IHC against von Willebrand factor (vWF) detected the presence of blood vessels in the metastases along the bone (Fig. 4D). The metastatic cancer cells were shown by IHC to express human CD44 (Fig. 4D)"

Although these approaches have been successful in demonstrating that engineered microenvironments can be used as target sites for metastatic spread and growth, they lacked evidence of the formation of a mature �organ� bone, the presence of a humanized microenvironment or the replication of cancer-induced bone degradation.We hypothesized that implanting hOB-seeded polymer scaffolds in mice in combination with rhBMP-7 would allow the replication of a mature and viable human bone microenvironment. Compared to bone chips, the hTEBCs have a distinct advantage in allowing control of the shape, size and surface properties of the implant as well as the opportunity to characterize the cell viability prior to implantation. The hTEBCs integrated well under the skin and did not result in wound problems or dehiscence that are common after implantation of sharp-edged bone pieces (Scepansky et al., 2001). The hTEBCs led to the formation of mineralized tissue in all implants, indicating a high reproducibility for this procedure. Mineralization was initiated in vitro when hOB cells were cultured under osteogenic conditions and progressed over time after in vivo implantation, yielding an amount of mineralized tissue that was comparable or higher than obtained in other recent models of ectopic bone development (Kempen et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010). Compared to mouse femurs, the hTEBCs led to more mineralized tissue formation, but the overall density of the tissue was lower. In a previous study on 242 human cancellous bone specimens from 70 donors and four different skeletal sites, the values measured for BV/TV ranged from ~5 to 30% (Ulrich et al., 1999). Thus, the mineralized tissue fraction observed in the hTEBCs more closely mimics the structure of human bone than endogenous mouse bones. Bone is a complex and dynamic organ that incorporates different hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types, proteins and growth factors in addition to the mineralized matrix, and undergoes constant remodeling. The hTEBC was able to reproduce not only the mineralized tissue component, but a viable and functional �organ� bone comprising live bone cells, bone marrow and adequate vascularization.There is increasing evidence that the bone microenvironment is able to actively promote BC cell colonization through the same pathways that are used for the homing of normal HSCs to the bone marrow (Psaila and Lyden, 2009). Thus, replicating a functional HSC niche is important in developing a physiological model of bone metastasis. Using progenitor cells transplanted under the adult mouse kidney capsule, Chan et al. demonstrated that endochondral ossification through the calcification of a cartilage intermediate is essential for the formation of an HSC niche in ectopic bone ossicles (Chan et al., 2009). Several studies have used BMPs for the induction of endochondral bone formation after subcutaneous implantation in mice and shown the recruitment of HSCs to these ectopic bone ossicles (Sasano et al., 1993; Kawai et al., 1994; Krebsbach et al., 2000; Rutherford et al., 2002; Tsumaki and Yoshikawa, 2005; Retting et al., 2009). However, in other engineered ectopic in vivo bone models using stem cells and CaP-based scaffolds bone formation occurred via an intramembranous mineralization process and also led to the formation of bone marrow compartments (Eyckmans et al., 2010; Chai et al., 2012). In line with these previous reports, we show evidence that hTEBCs with hOBs and rhBMP-7 replicate both pathways of bone formation that are physiologically found in the skeleton. IHC analysis demonstrated the presence of matrix-embedded osteocytes of human origin as well as human-derived collagen I and osteocalcin in the hTEBCs, thus indicating that the hOBs survived the implantation and were able to form mature bone and differentiate into osteocytes. Moreover, the presence of human spindle-shaped cells in the fibrous tissue and human chondrocyte-like cells in the cartilaginous tissue implies that the donor and not the host cells mainly participated in the endochondral bone formation. This finding is consistent with previous observations where osteoblastic cells obtained from explant cultures of adult human trabecular bone fragments displayed the ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages under controlled culture conditions (N�th et al., 2002). In particular, the cells were able to undergo chondrogenesis in vitro (N�th et al., 2002) and in vivo (Gundle et al., 1995).Our group has extensively characterized the ability of hOBs to differentiate into mature osteoblasts and produce a mineralized extracellular matrix containing proteins and growth factors characteristic of the bone matrix when cultured under osteogenic conditions (Reichert et al., 2010; Taubenberger et al., 2013). However, the presence of human fibroblast and chondrocyte-like cells in the hTEBCs suggests that a fraction of mesenchymal progenitor-like cells persists in the implanted cell population, accounting for the development of human-derived mesenchymal tissues other than bone. This is supported by the detection of single human CD146-positive mesenchymal progenitor cells in the hTEBCs. Moreover, Asahina et al. observed that rhBMP-7 treatment on primary cells obtained through explant culture of newborn rat calvaria induced chondrogenesis in vitro by acting on a primitive mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cell subpopulation, but did not appear to reverse committed osteoblasts (Asahina et al., 1993). In a later study, Tortelli et al. also demonstrated that the ossification type of the engineered bone in their model depended strictly on the nature and commitment of the seeded cells (Tortelli et al., 2010).IHC-positive staining of the human-derived bone matrix proteins collagen type I and osteocalcin was mostly located in the center of the bone organ, indicating that the outer cortical-like shell surrounding the scaffold is a chimeric tissue comprising both donor and host-derived extracellular matrix. Similar findings have been described in a previous study where BMP-7-expressing human gingival fibroblasts were used to engineer bone marrow-containing ossicles (Krebsbach et al., 2000). IHC against human and murine osteonectin, as well as genomic in situ hybridization with human-specific Alu probes, demonstrated that the bone was predominantly of human origin in the central region of the transplant and to a lesser extent in the peripheral cortical bone (Krebsbach et al., 2000). Finally, in addition to the replication of a physiological and functional �organ� bone, the hTEBCs provide a humanized bone microenvironment for the investigation of BC cell dissemination.We hypothesized that the engineered bone obtained with our model could be applied as a target site for metastasis by malignant BC cells injected intracardially. In vivo imaging allowed monitoring of the development and growth of multiorgan metastases over 4 weeks in mice. The mice were sacrificed when they started to display signs of illness characteristic of metastatic BC disease, such as hind limb paralysis from spinal metastases, labored breathing due to lung tumors or significant weight loss. When the hTEBCs were imaged individually ex vivo, successful dissemination of the metastatic BC cell lines to the scaffolds was observed. To our knowledge this is the first xenograft model of metastasis using the intracardiac injection of BC cells in combination with engineered bone, although this inoculation technique is widely used in traditional xenograft models of metastasis to the mouse skeleton. To date, only one study has combined an ectopic human bone chip model with the intracardiac inoculation of BC cells. Ling et al. showed that injection of 1�106 MDA-MB-231 cells in the left cardiac ventricle of SCID/berg female mice resulted in metastasis to implanted human bone chips in 20% of mice (Ling et al., 2008). In traditional xenograft models, MDA-MB-231 cells metastasize to the skeleton in about 30% of mice and the cells also spread to other organs, thus creating additional morbidity (Sasaki et al., 1995; Li et al., 2001; Yoneda et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2003). In our model we observed that the MDA-MB-231 cells homed to 50% of hTEBCs in 71.4% of mice, thus obtaining a higher take rate than previous studies. Numerous metastases to the mouse skeleton and other soft tissue organs were also detected. The bone-seeking MDA-MB-231BO cells were originally isolated by Yoneda et al. through repeated in vivo passaging of the parental MDA-MB-231 cells until they metastasized exclusively to the skeleton in 100% of mice, as determined histologically (Yoneda et al., 2001). In line with these results, MDA-MB-231BO cells exhibited a higher take rate than the parental cells in our model, with metastases detected in 85.7% of hTEBCs in 100% of mice and presenting a higher average bioluminescent signal.However, metastasis of MDA-MB-231BO cells was not specific to the humanized or mouse bone as the cells also spread to numerous other mouse organs. This observation can be explained by different factors. First, it is known that repeated in vitro passaging or variation in culture methods can lead to alterations in the biological behavior of cells, and unexpected changes in the metastatic patterns of cancer cell lines have been described previously (El-Mabhouh et al., 2008). Second, the immune deficiency of each mouse strain (i.e. nude versus NOD/SCID mice) can affect the frequency of metastasis and must be taken into account when comparing experimental observations in xenografts (Pearson and Pouliot, 2012). Finally, the higher incidence rate described in our model might derive from the more sensitive detection method of BLI versus histological analysis. Although both metastatic BC cell lines disseminated more frequently to hTEBCs compared to mice hind limbs, the metastatic process was not specific to the humanized bone microenvironment in our model. Previous studies with humanized xenograft models of BC bone metastasis using human bone chips reported a species-specificity of cancer osteotropism (Kuperwasser et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007; Lam et al., 2009b). However, this conclusion was often based on the screening of the mouse skeleton for metastases using the less-sensitive histological or X-ray-based detection methods. In a more recent study by Liu et al. using the same cell line, metastasis to both human and mouse bone was detected by whole-body BLI, which contradicted the group�s earlier result (Kuperwasser et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009).In this work, we confirmed that hTEBCs support metastasis by human BC cells injected into the blood circulation via intracardiac inoculation. We hypothesized that the metastases in our engineered bone would replicate features of BC-induced bone lesions. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231BO cells typically induce osteolytic metastases (Yoneda et al., 2001). In hTEBCs, the presence of human metastatic BC cells could be detected in the newly formed bone. Moreover, the irregular profile of the bone surface and the presence of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells in resorption pits indicated that osteoclasts were actively resorbing the bone in contact with the tumor cells. The osteoclasts also displayed a predilection for the surface of the CaP-coated scaffold fibers, and isolated cancer cells were seen invading the engineered tissues along the scaffold fibers. In fact, the bone inorganic component CaP has been shown to promote the adhesion and growth of metastatic tumor cells (Pathi et al., 2011). Blood vessels were detected adjacent to the bone invaded by metastatic cells, indicating that the BC cells could have reached the bone by arresting and extravasating from those vessels and that the blood supply promoted their development. Finally, the metastatic BC cells in the hTEBCs expressed human CD44, an adhesion receptor for the extracellular matrix proteins hyaluronan and osteopontin, which is known to promote cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis (Hiraga et al., 2013).The hTEBC is a controllable and reproducible system that supports the development of a physiological and functional humanized �organ� bone and that can be implemented as a target site for the homing of human BC cells and development of osteolytic metastases. Compared with traditional xenograft models of metastasis, hTEBCs recapitulate more closely the structural characteristics of human trabecular bone than mouse femurs and are more frequently colonized by circulating BC cells. Thus, the hTEBC provides a suitable humanized xenograft model for replication of species-specific human BC-related bone metastasis in vivo and could be applied in preclinical research to investigate the mechanisms underlying BC homing and colonization as well as for developing new treatment strategies. Although the current approach only incorporates human-derived bone cells and extracellular matrix, the use of an engineered construct provides the opportunity to manipulate the hTEBC in the future, for example by including human endothelium or hematopoietic cells, to eventually further humanize the model.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culturehOBs were isolated from bone samples obtained under informed consent from female patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery (Queensland University of Technology Research Ethics approval number 0600000232) and cultured as described previously (Reichert et al., 2010). MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231BO cells were kindly provided by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (San Antonio, TX) (Yoneda et al., 2001). The cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco�s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), 100 ?g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 1� Glutamax (Life Technologies). MCF10A cells were from the ATCC and cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) and penicillin/streptomycin. The cell lines were transduced to express luciferase using a pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO (Life Technologies) lentivirus and selected for at least 2 weeks using Blasticidin (InViVoGen, San Diego, CA) under the ethics approval number 1100000252 for work with genetically modified organisms.hTEBC preparationMedical grade PCL CAPA 6500C (Perstorp, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) with a molecular weight of 50 kDa was used to produce tubular scaffolds by melt electrospinning writing on a custom-built machine as previously described (Brown et al., 2012). The scaffolds were coated with CaP to promote cell attachment, following an established protocol (Vaquette et al., 2013). The scaffolds were sterilized, seeded with 200,000 hOBs and cultured as described previously until they were overgrown with hOBs (Brown et al., 2012). To induce differentiation, the tubes were then transferred from static cultures to the vessel of a bi-axial rotating bioreactor (Singh et al., 2005) containing 500 ml osteogenic media consisting of culture media supplemented with 50 ?g/ml L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 ?M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The bioreactor was placed in a heat-sterilized incubator (Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) to culture the cells at 37�C and 5% CO2 while the vessel rotated continuously along two independent axes to improve fluid flow. The medium was changed every 2 weeks. After 2 months, cultured scaffolds were removed from the bioreactor and 2 mm biopsy punches (Kai Medical, Tokyo, Japan) were used to stamp out small disks from the scaffolds for subsequent cell characterization. For in vivo investigations, each scaffold received 30 ?l of rhBMP-7 (1 ?g/?l) (Olympus Biotech Corporation, Hopkinton, MA) in combination with 60 ?l of human thrombin (TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, Baxter Healthcare International, Deerfield, IL) into the tubular cavity, before the addition of 60 ?l of human fibrinogen to induce fibrin gel formation (TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, Baxter Healthcare International). Constructs were kept on ice until implantation into mice.In vitro characterizationSurface analysis of the hTEBC was performed by SEM, and cell morphology was assessed by CLSM using a SP5 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) on cells stained for the microfilament F-actin and a nuclei counterstain with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), as described previously (Sieh et al., 2010). Live-dead staining was performed by incubating the cells at 37�C for 15 minutes with 3.35 ?g/ml fluorescein diacetate and 25 mg/ml propidium iodide (both sourced from Life Technologies) diluted in serum-free/phenol red-free media prior to z-stack acquisition by CLSM.Animal experiments and BLIAll animal experiments were approved by the Queensland University of Technology Animal Ethics Committee (approval number 0900000915) in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. Female NOD/SCID Mus musculus (mice) at 4 weeks old were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia, Australia) and held at the Pharmacy Australia Centre of Excellence animal facility from the University of Queensland (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). The animals were allowed to settle for 1 week prior to the subcutaneous implantation of one construct into each flank. Mineralized tissue formation occurred in 100% of hTEBCs and was monitored by X-ray analysis using an In-Vivo FX Image Station (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY) until sacrifice after 7 weeks (2 mice, n=4 hTEBCs) or 12 weeks (5 mice, n=10 hTEBCs).For the experimental metastasis assay, 18 mice were implanted with hTEBCs and bone was allowed to form for 10 weeks in vivo. Mineralized tissue formation occurred in 100% of hTEBCs. Then 105 BC cells suspended in 100 ?l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the left ventricle of the heart as described previously (Yoneda et al., 2001). One mouse died prematurely and was not included in subsequent analyses. Cancer cell dissemination was monitored weekly by in vivo BLI using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Image acquisition was performed 15 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg XenoLight D-Luciferin Potassium Salt (PerkinElmer). At the experimental end point, hTEBCs, mouse bones and organs were excised and ex vivo BLI was performed within 20�30 minutes after luciferin injection. Signals were quantified with the Living Image software (PerkinElmer) by drawing an automatic region of interest with a threshold set at 10% around each bioluminescent source to determine the amount of photons emitted for a given time. Only signals above 200 counts were considered positive. The take rates of metastasis to different tissues are indicated per mice, except where expressly stated for the hTEBCs (there were two constructs per mice). Explanted hTEBC and femur specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then transferred to 70% ethanol until further analysis.Ex vivo ?-CT analysisScans of hTEBCs were taken using a ?-CT 40 scanner (Scanco Medical, Br�ttisellen, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 20 ?m, intensity of 145 ?A and voltage of 55 kV. Samples were evaluated at a threshold of 150, a filter width of 0.8 and filter support of 1. X-ray attenuation was correlated to sample density using a standard curve generated by scanning hydroxyapatite phantoms with known mineral density. BV, BV/TV and BMD were quantified. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaPlot software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). A Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed. The statistical differences between groups were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance for data that showed a normal distribution. Data that failed the normality test were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks. P<0.05 was considered significant.Histology and IHCFixed samples were decalcified for 5 weeks in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) with weekly changes and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections near the central area of the implants were used for H&E staining and IHC analysis of the expression of human NuMA (dilution 1:100; S2825, Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), vWF (1:300; ab7356, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), collagen type II (1:200; II-II6B3, DSHB, Iowa City, IA), human CD44 (1:50; H4C4, DSHB), human mitochondria (1:500; ab92824, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), human collagen type I (1:300; I-8H5, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), human osteocalcin (1:200; ab13420, Abcam) and human CD146 (1:25; NCL-CD146, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). For IHC, de-waxed and rehydrated sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. When targeting intracellular proteins, 6 minutes permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS was performed. For antigen retrieval, the sections were either incubated with proteinase K (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 minutes at room temperature or placed in trisodium citrate buffer (pH 6) for 4 minutes at 95�C, before blocking with 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 minutes. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody solutions in blocking buffer overnight at 4�C, followed by 1 hour of incubation at room temperature with EnVision+ Dual Link System-HRP Rabbit/Mouse (Dako). Color development was performed with liquid diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dako) and sections were counterstained with Mayer�s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Human tissue and mouse bone sections were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, for human-specific antibodies.TRAP stainingDe-waxed and rehydrated sections were washed for 5 minutes in deionized water and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in 0.2 M acetate buffer consisting of 0.2 M sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mM sodium L-tartrate dehydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water. Then, sections were transferred to acetate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.1 mg/ml Fast Red TR salt 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate salt (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were incubated at 37�C for 2 hours until osteoclasts appeared red. Then, sections were rinsed in deionized water, counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with an aqueous medium (Clear-Mount, ProSciTech, Thuringowa, Queensland, Australia).

Breast_Cancer "Purpose Diarrhea in relation to the lapatinib�capecitabine regimen is a common and debilitating side effect which may interfere with optimal treatment delivery. We performed a post hoc analysis in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer patients treated with a modified schedule in its administration, aimed primarily to evaluate grade (G) ?2 diarrhea incidence and, secondarily, treatment efficacy. Patients and methods Treatment schedule consisted of lapatinib 1,250 mg daily for the first 10 days, then in combination with capecitabine, 2,000 mg/m2, starting day 11 for the first cycle, and thereafter from day 8, for 14 days of a 21-day cycle, in 3 daily administrations. Lapatinib was dissolved in water, and cholestyramine was continuously given twice a day. Results Among 38 patients treated and analyzed, the incidence of G ? 2 diarrhea was 13.2 %. In 28 patients diarrhea was not observed, while G1�2 diarrhea was reported in 9 (23.7 %) patients; a single episode of G3 diarrhea was observed in 1 (2.6 %) patient. Overall response rate was 34.2 %, clinical benefit 55.3 %, and median progression-free survival 10 months. Conclusion The results of the present post hoc analysis are very encouraging, both in terms of tolerability and treatment efficacy, and all data compare favorably with previous reports of �conventional� administration of the lapatinib�capecitabine regimen. Keywords HER2-positive Advanced breast cancer Lapatinib Capecitabine Diarrhea Schedule modification issue-copyright-statement � Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 Introduction Amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2 or HER2) occurs in approximately 20 % of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody toward the extracellular domain of HER2 receptor, combined with chemotherapy, increases time to progression and overall survival in advanced breast cancer patients. However, resistance to trastuzumab unfortunately is present or develops (Ross et al. 2009; Dawood et al. 2010). Lapatinib, an orally available small molecule reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an in vitro and in vivo potent selective dual inhibitor of ErbB1 (EGFR) and HER2 receptor, has been approved since 2007 in combination with capecitabine for treatment of metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2 and previously treated with anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab. Lapatinib inhibits ErbB1 and HER2 intracellular kinase domains; it is known to be active in ErbB1 mutants and truncated forms of HER2 receptor (p95), and can overcome the resistance to trastuzumab (Blackwell et al. 2009; Burstein et al. 2008; Gomez et al. 2008; Iwata et al. 2006). The association of lapatinib and capecitabine was evaluated in a phase III randomized trial (Geyer et al. 2006; Cameron et al. 2010), showing the efficacy of the combination treatment after trastuzumab failure, and the superiority over capecitabine alone in anthracycline and taxane pretreated advanced breast cancer patients. Among the most common adverse events observed in the registrative trial was diarrhea, representing the main limiting toxicity, occurring in more than a half of the patients in the combination arm (60 %), and partially reducing treatment compliance. Moreover, it was the most serious G3�4 adverse event [together with hand-foot syndrome, (HFS)], occurring in 12 % (G3) and 1 % (G4) of the patients, respectively (Geyer et al. 2006). In the expanded access program (LEAP), diarrhea was the most frequently reported drug-related serious adverse event (9.7 %) (Capri et al. 2010). Other clinical studies reported similar results, confirming diarrhea as the most common side effect occurring with lapatinib plus capecitabine regimen, requiring drug dose modification or treatment interruption in some cases (Crown et al. 2008). The frequency and severity of diarrhea, along with the not unusual long duration of the toxic effect, may limit full dosing and optimal treatment duration, possibly having an impact on treatment efficacy. In clinical practice, outside of clinical studies, diarrhea in relation to lapatinib plus capecitabine treatment is a well-known side effect and, even if often of low grade, it is a common knowledge how it may lead to a reduced treatment compliance and a lower quality of life in treated patients. Treatment guidelines for the management of lapatinib-associated toxicities (primarily diarrhea) are available (Crown et al. 2008; Benson et al. 2004; Moy and Goss 2007), and clinicians are now more capable of managing this toxic adverse event effectively in clinical practice, but diarrhea still represents an important limitation to the optimal regimen delivery in many patients. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of the frequent gastrointestinal toxicity observed in patients treated with conventional schedule of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen, and to increase treatment compliance, a modified administration schedule was adopted. This consisted in administering capecitabine from day 11 instead of day 1 for the first cycle, then in subsequent cycles from day 8, and permanently dividing the planned capecitabine dose in three daily doses as a chronomodulated schedule as suggested by Santini et al. (2006). Moreover, lapatinib was dissolved in water, and cholestyramine was administered twice a day. This treatment schedule modification was applied to patients candidating for conventional lapatinib�capecitabine regimen. We recruited patients from nine Italian cancer centers, all treated with the above described modified administration schedule. Patients and methods Our analysis comprises of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer patient candidates for treatment with lapatinib�capecitabine. The HER2 status was considered positive if the local institution reported grade 3+ staining intensity (on a scale of 0�3) by immunohistochemical analysis, or grade 2+ staining intensity with gene amplification on fluorescence or chromogenic in situ hybridization. Patients recruited had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the institution�s normal ranges, and adequate organs and hematological functions. The treatment schedule consisted of lapatinib, at a dose of 1,250 mg daily, 1 h before or after breakfast, administered as single agent for the first 10 days, then continuously, in combination with capecitabine, which was given at a dose of 2,000 mg/m2, starting on day 11 (for the first cycle), and then from day 8, for 14 days out of a 21-day cycle, and with a chronomodulated schedule (25 % of the dose at 8.00 a.m., 25 % at 12.00 a.m., and 50 % at 22.00 p.m.). According to the third amendment of ALLTO trial, lapatinib was always dissolved in water; furthermore, cholestyramine was administered, twice a day on a continuous basis, long after capecitabine and lapatinib intake. Standard efficacy and toxicity evaluations were performed in all the patients treated, paying special attention to diarrhea incidence and severity. The number and duration of diarrhea episodes were reported by patients in a personal diary. Treatment was given until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Standard recommendations for capecitabine and lapatinib dosage modifications were followed for the management of adverse events. The primary endpoint of the analysis was the evaluation of the tolerability of treatment in terms of diarrhea G ? 2 incidence and of the patients� compliance; secondary end points were treatment efficacy evaluation, in terms of overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit (CB, responses and stable disease for at least 6 months), response duration, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize pertinent study information. The association between variables was tested by the Pearson�s Chi-square test or Fisher�s exact test, when appropriate. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan�Meier product-limit method from the treatment starting date until the time of death (OS), progression (PFS), or last visit (OS and PFS), whichever applicable. SPSS software (SPSS version 20.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for all statistical evaluations. Results From November 2010 to December 2012, 38 HER2-overexpressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients were treated with the modified schedule of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen in 9 Italian cancer centers. Main patient and tumor characteristics are reported in Table 1. Twenty-one patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, in 13 patients combined or followed by adjuvant trastuzumab; the remaining 8 patients received chemotherapy without trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment. Ten patients received neoadjuvant treatment, in 9 patients including trastuzumab (one patient chemotherapy only). Eight patients received adjuvant endocrine treatment for 5 years, concomitantly to trastuzumab for 6 months; 15 patients received endocrine treatment in combination with trastuzumab for advanced disease. In regard to chemotherapy, the median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 1 (76.3 %), ranging from 1 to 4 overall. All of the patients had previously been treated with trastuzumab, ranging from 1 to 4 previous lines, including neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, but most of the patients (78.9 %) had received only one prior chemotherapy regimen containing trastuzumab for advanced disease. The median number of cycles of lapatinib�capecitabine modified schedule delivered was 7 (range 2�21). Altogether, 330 cycles were administered. Ten women (26.3 %) received more than 10 cycles of therapy.

None of the patients discontinued or reduced lapatinib dose for any reason when lapatinib was given as single agent in the first 10 days of treatment. Overall, in 312/330 (94.5 %) cycles administered and in 28/38 patients, no treatment-related diarrhea was observed; 5 patients (13.2 %) experienced G1 diarrhea (11/330 cycles, 3.3 %), and 4 patients (10.5 %) experienced G2 diarrhea (6/330 cycles, 1.8 %), while G3 diarrhea was observed in only 1 (2.6 %) patient in the second cycle (1/330 cycles, 0.3 %). No episodes of G4 diarrhea were recorded (Table 2). Overall, the incidence of G2 or more severe diarrhea in our analysis was 13.2 %. No capecitabine or lapatinib diarrhea-related discontinuation was observed, and in the only one patient experiencing a single episode of G3 diarrhea, a 25 % capecitabine dose-reduction was performed for 2 weeks, rapidly improving the symptom. In regard to other toxicities, cutaneous toxicity was the only side effect leading to dose reduction and/or treatment discontinuation (Table 3). Three patients had to reduce capecitabine dose use due to HFS, after 7, 9, and 10 cycles, respectively, and in 1 patient, capecitabine was definitively discontinued due to G3 HFS, while lapatinib was continued as monotherapy until disease progression. Other relevant toxicities observed were rash and ungueal alterations, with no cases of rash G3/G4, 2 (5.3 %) patients experiencing transient G1 rash, and 7 (18.4 %) patients G2 rash, after more than 8 cycles, with only 1 patient discontinuing capecitabine for 2 weeks, with a prompt resolution of the symptom. Ungueal alterations, usually mild, occurred in 6 patients, and were G1 in 1 patient and G2 in 5 patients. Other toxicities were in the range of reported literature data. We did not observe any clinical cardiotoxicity, nor significant decreases of LVEF. No toxic deaths were recorded.

This frequently has a negative impact on patients� quality of life, where the dose reduction, interruption, and discontinuation of treatment may negatively influence the efficacy in daily clinical practice. In the present analysis, we intended to assess whether a change in the timing and mode of administration of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen, in combination with support medication, could lead to a reduction in treatment-related main toxicities, with a particular focus on diarrhea. Our results satisfy a post hoc statistical hypothesis according to A�Hern exact single-stage phase II design (2001), considering a percentage of diarrhea of grade ?2 higher than 35 % (10) unacceptable, and assuming levels ?15 %, with a significance of 5 % and a power of 90 %, interesting. Although lapatinib provides a new treatment option for the management of HER2 positive breast cancer patients, and the combination with capecitabine represents an active and consolidated treatment choice in trastuzumab-resistant disease, clinicians and patients still face a number of clinical challenges, including minimizing toxicity. In fact, toxic effects of cancer treatments are one of the main limitations among planned dose-intensity maintenance, as well as having a relevant impact on costs, and on quality of life, which is of paramount importance in the advanced stages of the disease, where a satisfactory quality of life represents one of the major goals of the treatments. Moreover, patient non-adherence to oral antineoplastic therapy, especially if not well tolerated, is a well-known barrier to treatment effect. The search for alternative drug administration schedules that allow to reduce the toxic effects of standard therapy is a major challenge to make the patients to be able to assume adequately therapy, and to improve their quality of life. Gastrointestinal side effects, mainly diarrhea of any grade, are described in the literature data in more than a half of the patients with lapatinib as single agent (Crown et al. 2008). The data from the trial of Gomez show, for lapatinib 1,500 mg daily as monotherapy, an incidence of diarrhea of 46 %, usually mild, being of grade 3 only in 1 % of patients (2008). In the ALLTO adjuvant trial, diarrhea of any grade was reported in 61 % of patients, being of grade 3�4 in 6 % of patients in the lapatinib arm (Goss et al. 2013). In regard to the use of lapatinib in combination with antineoplastic agents other than capecitabine, phase III trials in neoadjuvant setting showed a higher incidence of treatment interruptions in the arms containing lapatinib, mainly due to diarrhea. The NeoALTTO trial reports 21 % of grade 3 diarrhea in the lapatinib arm, whereas in the CherLob trial, grade 3�4 diarrhea was recorded in 37 % of patients (in association with chemotherapy) (Baselga et al. 2012; Guarneri et al. 2012). In the GeparQuinto neoadjuvant trial, diarrhea of any grade was observed in 75 % of the patients, being of grade 3�4 in 11.7 % of the patients (Untch et al. 2012). The combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in the phase III registrative trial determined grade 3 diarrhea in 12 % of patients, with 1 % of patients experiencing grade 4 diarrhea, while mild (grade 1�2) diarrhea occurred in 47 % of patients. These effects led to treatment discontinuation in 3 % of patients, while delays or dose reductions have been reported in 11 % and 5 % of patients, respectively (Geyer et al. 2006; Crown et al. 2008). In a pooled analysis of nine phase I�II�III trials evaluating diarrhea, in which lapatinib was administered at doses ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 mg daily as a single agent or in combination with capecitabine or taxanes, diarrhea occurred in 54 % of lapatinib-treated patients and in 24 % of patients not receiving lapatinib. In more detail, diarrhea of any grade was reported in 51 % of the patients treated with lapatinib as a single agent, in 65 % of patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine, and in 48 % of patients treated with lapatinib plus a taxane. The symptom was usually mild to moderate, being of grade 3 in less than 10 % of patients, and of grade 4 in less than 1 % of patients. Moreover, grade 3 diarrhea in 10�17 % of the patients treated with 1,500 mg once daily was reported, whereas this percentage increased to 21 % in patients treated with 750 mg BID, suggesting an association with dose and schedule. In regard to timing of symptom development, approximately 40 % of patients developed diarrhea within the first 6 days of treatment. In addition, each diarrhea episode lasted a mean of 7�9 days, and most (81 % in the lapatinib�capecitabine group) diarrhea events were resolved without dose-modification and with conventional approaches, even if 16 % of patients had to reduce doses or delay treatment, with 3 % discontinuing treatment (Crown et al. 2008). In order to improve gastrointestinal tolerability of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen in advanced breast cancer, other sporadic experiences with treatment schedule modification were carried out. A recently published report on lapatinib�capecitabine schedule modification, consisting of a 7 day capecitabine intake followed by a 7 day rest, reported satisfactory activity and an improvement in gastrointestinal toxicity, with no cases experiencing G3�4 diarrhea, with G2 diarrhea occurring in 26 % of patients (Gajria et al. 2012). In our experience, the difficulty in successfully managing of diarrhea often limiting patients compliance in terms of treatment adherence and a decreased quality of life has been addressed by delaying the administration of capecitabine in the first cycle of treatment, which was introduced in a chronomodulated manner when lapatinib was administered as a single agent after a 10-day time frame. At the same time, lapatinib was dissolved in water, and cholestyramine was given after lapatinib consumption to counter possible drug interference. These schedule modifications were successfully tolerated by most patients. In fact, we observed a very high adherence to therapy administered, with a median of 7 cycles delivered and 10 patients (26.3 %) receiving more than 10 cycles, observing a particularly low incidence of grade 2 diarrhea (10.5 %), with only one episode of grade 3, and no episodes of grade 4 diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea of grade ?2 in the present experience (13.2 %) compares favorably with conventional lapatinib plus capecitabine regimens in the literature data, reporting an incidence of approximately 33 % (Geyer et al. 2006; Crown et al. 2008). Moreover, the efficacy of lapatinib�capecitabine treatment observed in our patient population was very encouraging, with an ORR of 34.2 %, a CB of 55.3 %, a median duration of response of 16 months, and a median PFS of 10 months. These compare favorably with other results of lapatinib�capecitabine regimens administered with standard schedules, reporting response rates ranging from 22 to 30.8 %, a median response duration of about 6.5 months, and a median PFS ranging from 5.0 to 8.4 months (Geyer et al. 2006; Capri et al. 2010; Verma et al. 2012). Moreover, in our experience, treatment was safely tolerated for a long period in many patients, confirming its optimal tolerability. Whether this consistent improvement in tolerability and the related toxicities increased patients compliance may have favorably influenced regimen efficacy is difficult to demonstrate, but the characteristics of patients in the present analysis do not differ from those enrolled in other published trials, and the possible effect on treatment efficacy cannot be excluded either. On the whole, even taking into consideration the limitations of a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients treated across different cancer centers, our experience with the above reported modified schedule of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer patients can be considered a very satisfactory experience, with encouraging treatment efficacy results and, above all, an optimal quality of life in the treated patients. Conclusions Our experience of applying the modified schedule of lapatinib�capecitabine regimen led to a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of treatment-related diarrhea, allowing optimal delivery of chemotherapy with encouraging efficacy data, while maintaining a good quality of life in the majority of patients treated.

Nationally, little is known regarding the contribution of a patient's surgeon to needle biopsy use, and knowledge regarding downstream impact of needle biopsy on breast cancer care is incomplete. Methods Using 2003 to 2007 nationwide Medicare data from 89,712 patients with breast cancer and 12,405 surgeons, logistic regression evaluated the following three outcomes: surgeon consultation before versus after biopsy, use of needle biopsy (yes or no), and number of surgeries for cancer treatment. Multilevel analyses were adjusted for physician, patient, and structural covariates. Results Needle biopsy was used in 68.4% (n = 61,353) of all patients and only 53.7% of patients seen by a surgeon before biopsy (n = 32,953/61,312). Patient factors associated with surgeon consultation before biopsy included Medicaid coverage, rural residence, residence more than 8.1 miles from a radiologic facility performing needle biopsy, and no mammogram within 60 days before consultation. Among patients with surgeon consultation before biopsy, surgeon factors such as absence of board certification, training outside the United States, low case volume, earlier decade of medical school graduation, and lack of specialization in surgical oncology were negatively correlated with receipt of needle biopsy. Risk of multiple cancer surgeries was 33.7% for patients undergoing needle biopsy compared with 69.6% for those who did not (adjusted relative risk, 2.08; P < .001). Conclusion Needle biopsy is underused in the United States, resulting in a negative impact on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Surgeon-level interventions may improve needle biopsy rates and, accordingly, quality of care. Br J Cancer Br. J.

The interim analysis revealed no difference in overall survival (OS; primary end point) between treatment arms; however, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate were significantly superior with BEV�PAC. We sought to identify patient populations that may be most appropriately treated with one or other regimen. Methods: Patients with HER2-negative LR/mBC who had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomised to either BEV�PAC (bevacizumab 10?mg?kg?1 days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90?mg?m?2 days 1, 8 and 15 q4w) or BEV�CAP (bevacizumab 15?mg?kg?1 day 1 plus capecitabine 1000?mg?m?2 bid days 1�14 q3w). The study population was categorised into three cohorts: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high-risk hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and low-risk HR+. High- and low-risk HR+ were defined, respectively, as having ?2 vs ?1 of the following four risk factors: disease-free interval ?24 months; visceral metastases; prior (neo)adjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane; and metastases in ?3 organs. Results: The treatment effect on OS differed between cohorts. Non-significant OS trends favoured BEV�PAC in the TNBC cohort and BEV�CAP in the low-risk HR+ cohort. In all three cohorts, there was a non-significant PFS trend favouring BEV�PAC. Grade ?3 adverse events were consistently less common with BEV�CAP. Conclusions: A simple risk factor index may help in selecting bevacizumab-containing regimens, balancing outcome, safety profile and patient preference. Final OS results are expected in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00600340). bevacizumab metastatic breast cancer triple-negative breast cancer risk factor prognostic index Nucleic Acids Res Nucleic Acids Res nar nar Nucleic Acids Research 0305-1048 1362-4962 Oxford University Press 25074380 4150776 10.1093/nar/gku664 RNA Identification of discrete classes of small nucleolar RNA featuring different ends and RNA binding protein dependency Deschamps-Francoeur Gabrielle 1 Garneau Daniel 2 3 Dupuis-Sandoval Fabien 1 Roy Audrey 1 Frappier Marie 1 Catala Mathieu 2 3 Couture Sonia 2 3 Barbe-Marcoux M�lissa 1 Abou-Elela Sherif 2 3 * Scott Michelle S. 1 * 1D�partement de biochimie, Facult� de m�decine et des sciences de la sant�, Universit� de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Qu�bec J1E 4K8, Canada 2Laboratoire de g�nomique fonctionnelle de l'Universit� de Sherbrooke, Qu�bec J1E 4K8, Canada 3D�partement de microbiologie et d'infectiologie, Facult� de m�decine et des sciences de la sant�, Universit� de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Qu�bec J1E 4K8, Canada *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are among the first discovered and most extensively studied group of small non-coding RNA. However, most studies focused on a small subset of snoRNAs that guide the modification of ribosomal RNA. In this study, we annotated the expression pattern of all box C/D snoRNAs in normal and cancer cell lines independent of their functions. The results indicate that C/D snoRNAs are expressed as two distinct forms differing in their ends with respect to boxes C and D and in their terminal stem length. Both forms are overexpressed in cancer cell lines but display a conserved end distribution. Surprisingly, the long forms are more dependent than the short forms on the expression of the core snoRNP protein NOP58, thought to be essential for C/D snoRNA production. In contrast, a subset of short forms are dependent on the splicing factor RBFOX2. Analysis of the potential secondary structure of both forms indicates that the k-turn motif required for binding of NOP58 is less stable in short forms which are thus less likely to mature into a canonical snoRNP. Taken together the data suggest that C/D snoRNAs are divided into at least two groups with distinct maturation and functional preferences. cover-date 2 September 2014 INTRODUCTION Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are ubiquitous ribonucleoprotein particles required for the processing, modification and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (1�3). This abundant group of small RNA is divided into two families based on activity and structural features: the C/D snoRNAs are responsible for 2?-O-ribose methylation and the H/ACA snoRNAs catalyze pseudouridylation of their targets (4�6). snoRNAs of both families guide their associated protein catalytic subunit (the pseudouridylase dyskerin for H/ACA snoRNAs and the methyltransferase fibrillarin for C/D snoRNAs) by base pairing between the snoRNA guide region and the target sequence in rRNA and snRNA (6�8). Box C/D snoRNAs are 50�100 nucleotides (nt)-long transcripts featuring conserved box C (RUGAUGA where R is a purine) and box D (CUGA) motifs that align to form a characteristic structural motif called the kink-turn or K-turn motif (4,7,9�11), as illustrated in Figure 1A. K-turn motifs are widespread in many classes of RNA and involve non-canonical G�A base pairing causing a tight kink in the axis of double-stranded RNA (12,13). The k-turn motif is typically flanked by a 5� canonical stem composed of regular base pairs and by a 3� non-canonical stem consisting of the G�A base pairs (11,13). The minor grooves of the canonical and non-canonical stems can interact, coordinated by metal ions or binding proteins, stabilizing the structure (11). In box C/D snoRNAs, constrained by the sequences of the boxes C and D, the non-canonical G�A stem is typically followed by one pair of U�U mismatched nucleotides and two canonical base pairs (Figure 1A). Both the canonical stem and the extended non-canonical stem appear to be important for proper processing of the snoRNA (14) and assembly of the snoRNP complex. In vertebrates, most snoRNAs are encoded in introns and co-transcribed from the promoter of their host genes. The assembly of the pre-snoRNP complex typically occurs on spliced and debranched introns and is initiated by the recognition of the k-turn structure by the core binding protein 15.5K (15�20). The binding of 15.5K to the k-turn provides a scaffold for the assembly of the box C/D snoRNP complex which includes additional core binding proteins NOP56, NOP58 and the methyltransferase fibrillarin (15,21�26). The resulting pre-snoRNPs are exonucleolytically trimmed from both the 5? and 3? ends, generating mature snoRNPs (19,20,27). The binding of the core proteins likely protects the snoRNAs from further trimming and determines their exact termini (14). Disruption of the k-turn and flanking stems prevents stable accumulation of snoRNAs (14,22), underlining the importance of these motifs for the appropriate processing and the stability of C/D snoRNAs and the proper structure and assembly C/D snoRNPs. Figure 1. Comparison of box C/D snoRNA expression patterns in normal and cancer cell lines. (A) Schematic representation of box C/D snoRNA structure. Box C/D snoRNAs are small non-coding RNAs featuring two short sequence motifs (C: RUGAUGA and D: CUGA) that are aligned together through base pairing to form a characteristic structural k-turn motif. This motif typically involves a bulge upstream from the box C and non-canonical A�G and G�A base pairing between box C and D residues, preceded on the 5? side by a stem involving canonical base pairing (12). X and R represent any nucleotide and purines, respectively. The 3? end terminus of the short and long snoRNA forms detected in this study are indicated by arrows. (B) The processing pattern of box C/D snoRNA is conserved in normal and cancer cells. Sequence reads mapping to at least 77% of full-length box C/D snoRNAs in normal (BJ-Tielf, INOF), breast (MCF-7) and ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3ip) were counted and plotted with respect to their corresponding boxes C and D for every residue of all box C/D snoRNAs. CPM indicates count per million. All experiments were performed in duplicate. (C) Identification of two distinct forms of C/D snoRNA. Two general forms (long and short) of box C/D snoRNAs were identified according to the distance between their ends and their characteristic C/D motifs. The short forms (snoRNASH) start 4 or 5 nt upstream of their box C and end 2 or 3 nt downstream of their box D, while the long forms (snoRNAL) start 5 or 6 nt upstream of their box C and end 4 or 5 nt downstream of their box D. The number of snoRNAs displaying only short or only long forms, a mix of the two forms or neither long nor short forms (other) was counted in the different cell lines and presented in the form of a histogram. The standard deviation between the duplicate experiments is shown as error bars. Most C/D snoRNAs in vertebrate genomes are located within the introns of genes that typically code for proteins involved in related functions like translation and ribosome biogenesis (22,23). However, in human only ?20% of the 269 annotated box C/D snoRNAs in snoRNABase (28) are found in genes coding for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis or translation. Strikingly, over 50% of human snoRNAs are not associated with established coding genes but instead are generated from long non-coding or hypothetical host genes. This suggests that some human snoRNAs may have functions other than rRNA modification. Indeed, recent studies have revealed non-canonical characteristics for some snoRNAs including members with no rRNA targets (referred to as orphan snoRNAs) (22,29), smaller stable and conserved RNA fragments derived from snoRNAs (30�32), non-canonical functionality for some snoRNAs including miRNA-like functions (33�36) and a role in the regulation of alternative splicing (30,32,37). In addition, despite the fundamental housekeeping role of many snoRNAs, their abundance is cell type and condition dependent (38�40) and specific snoRNAs display significantly altered expression in diverse cancers, some having been described as tumor suppressors or oncogenes (41�43). Despite two decades of extensive studies, our knowledge of snoRNA biology in human remains limited to a small subset of canonical snoRNAs required for rRNA modification. The processing mechanism and protein factors required for the function of the majority of orphan snoRNAs and their contribution to cell- and tissue-specific function is largely unexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive analysis of the expression pattern, protein requirement and cell specificity of all known human box C/D snoRNAs. Paired-end sequencing of RNA extracted from a variety of normal and cancer cell lines indicates that while most snoRNAs are upregulated in cancer cell lines their overall processing patterns are conserved. Surprisingly, snoRNAs are not expressed as a homogenous population with randomly heterogeneous termini as previously believed. Instead, we found that box C/D snoRNAs fall into two groups, the first displaying long ends (snoRNAL) and the second with short ends (snoRNASH). The long forms exhibit the features of canonical snoRNAs while snoRNAs produced as short forms include more orphans and non-canonical snoRNAs. Strikingly, the snoRNAL are more sensitive to the depletion of the core snoRNP protein NOP58 while a subset of snoRNASH are affected by the depletion of the splicing factor RBFOX2 that was previously shown to bind snoRNA flanking long non-coding RNA (44). Together the data suggest that some snoRNAs are differentially processed to form snoRNP with distinct protein components. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfections All cell lines were cultured in antibiotic- and antimycotic-free media (Wisent). The ovarian adenocarcinoma SKOV3ip1 cell line was grown in DMEM/F12 (50/50) medium (Wisent), the breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line was grown in EMEM (Wisent) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and MEM nonessential amino acid (Wisent), the immortalized normal ovarian fibroblast cell line INOF was grown in OSE (ovarian surface epithelium) medium (Wisent) and normal immortalized skin fibroblast BJ-Tielf was grown in alpha-MEM (Wisent). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cell propagation and passaging were as recommended by American Type Culture Collection. For transfection, cells were seeded at 350 000 cells per well in 6-well plates (BD Biosciences). Transfections were performed in suspension using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol and 20 nM of 21-mer siRNA (Sigma) for 48 h. All cell lines were actively growing when harvested. All knockdowns (KD) were done in duplicate using different siRNAs for each sample and were validated by qPCR (Supplementary File 1, Figure S1). The sequences of the siRNAs used are the following: CUUCUACCGUUCAGAUUCU (NOP58 KD 1), GACAAGUCCCAAACACAAA (NOP58 KD 2), GAUGGUCACACCAUAUGCA (RBFOX2 KD 1), CACCUCCGCAGAAUGGAAU (RBFOX2 KD 2). RNA extraction and quantitative PCR Total RNA extractions were performed using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA integrity of each sample was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Reverse transcription was performed at 55�C on a fixed volume (11 ?l) of RNA sample with Transcriptor (Roche Diagnostics), random hexamers, dNTPs and 10 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 ?l. All cDNAs were diluted in RNAse DNAse-free water (IDT). Quantitative PCR reactions (Supplementary File 1, Figure S1) were performed on 10 ng of cDNA as described elsewhere (45). Relative expression levels were calculated using the qBASE framework (46) using PSMC4 and SDHA as reference genes. Primer design and validation were evaluated as described (45). In every run, a no template control was performed for each primer pair. These controls were consistently negative. To measure the abundance of U31 (Supplementary File 1, Figure S6), real-time PCR quantification was performed as described (45). Fifty nanogram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) and the PCRs were performed in a realplex (Eppendorf) using primers complementary to the sequence of U31 RNA (U31_forward: TGAGTTGAATACCGCCCCAG and U31_reverse: GCTCAGAAAA TACCTTTCAGTCAC). Preparation of small RNA samples for RNA-seq Small RNAs (<200 nt in length) were isolated from the different cell lines and transfected cell lines considered using a low molecular weight RNA extraction kit (mirVana, Invitrogen) and from these samples, cDNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq small RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) which includes adapter ligation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The quality of the RNA and libraries were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Supplementary File 1, Figure S2). The resulting cDNA libraries were paired-end sequenced on Illumina HiSeq sequencers at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. For these sequencing runs, eight samples were multiplexed per lane, resulting in between 15M and 24M paired reads per dataset. Paired-end sequencing was chosen because the length of some of the molecules of interest surpassed the read length (which was 100 nt). Additionally, the paired-end sequencing ensures high-quality sequences at both ends of the RNAs of interest. It should be noted that because only RNAs of <200 nt in length were kept and the paired-end read length used was 2 � 100 nt, all small RNAs present in our sequencing dataset were entirely sequenced (including the middle of the molecule). The sequencing datasets were deposited in GEO (GSE55946). Processing of RNA-seq datasets Because many small RNAs isolated using our procedure are shorter than the sequencing read length (100 nt), the 3? adapters were still present in the fastq files for many read pairs. Cutadapt (47) was used to remove the adapters and control the quality of the sequences. Parameters were set to -minimum-length 2, -match-read-wildcards, -q 3 and the adapter sequences were TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG (R1 file) and GATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAAC (R2 file). The resulting reads were aligned to the build hg19 of the human genome using Bowtie2 (48) with parameters �local, -I 13. SAMtools (49) and BEDTools (50) were used to obtain the positions of all reads on the small RNAs of interest and calculate alignment statistics. Reference sequences of snoRNAs, miRNAs and tRNAs were obtained respectively from snoRNAbase (28), miRBase version 18 (51) and the genomic tRNA database (52). Sequences of snRNAs and rRNAs were obtained from Genbank (53) and sequences of Y RNAs were obtained from the supplementary material of (54). Accumulation profiles of full-length snoRNAs in different cell lines and abundance of different forms To be considered in these analyses, snoRNAs had to be represented by at least 10 reads covering at least 77% of the full-length snoRNA as defined in snoRNAbase (28). For analyses considering all reads mapping to full-length snoRNAs regardless of forms (Figures 3A and 4A), the normalized abundance value per snoRNA (one value per snoRNA) as well as per miRNA, per tRNA, per rRNA, per YRNA and per snRNA was calculated using DESeq (55). The fold change following the depletions (Figures 3A and 4A) was calculated as the average normalized abundance value in the two depletion samples divided by the average normalized abundance in the three mock-treated (Lipofectamine) samples. Figure 2. The long form of box C/D snoRNA (snoRNAL) features extended base pairing downstream of the k-turn structural motif. (A) The long and short snoRNA forms share the basic structural features of box C/D snoRNA. The characteristic box C, box D and k-turn were identified and their level of sequence conservation in each class of snoRNA was determined using the sequence obtained from the SKOV3ip1 cell line. The number and percent of snoRNAs displaying each feature are shown. Only predominant snoRNA forms expressed above 1 CPM in both replicates were counted. (B) The snoRNAL form features more stable k-turn structure. The length of the external stem was measured using SKOV3ip1 RNA for snoRNAs only expressed as short or only expressed as long forms. The proportion of snoRNAs from these two groups is expressed as a function of the number of paired nucleotides in their external stem. (C) Schematic representation of the external stem observed in snoRNAs only expressed as long or short snoRNA forms. The percentage of snoRNAs containing the different number of base pairs downstream of box D is shown on the right of each form. The orange and blue boxes indicate the position of the C and D motifs, respectively. Figure 3. Depletion of the core box C/D snoRNA binding protein NOP58 preferentially downregulates the expression of the long snoRNA forms. (A) KD of NOP58 inhibits the expression of some box C/D and not H/ACA snoRNAs. NOP58 was knocked down in SKOV3ip1 using two independent siRNAs and the impact on the abundance of RNA shorter than 200 nt (snoRNA, miRNA, snRNA, YRNA and tRNA) was calculated relative to the level in mock-transfected cells (LF). The log2 fold change in RNA abundance is shown in the form of scatter plots. The different small RNA members are indicated by blue dots, while the box C/D (left panel) and H/ACA snoRNA (right panel) are highlighted in red. The dashed lines represent a decrease of 2-fold in the NOP58 depletion. (B) Effect of the NOP58 KD on the different forms of box C/D snoRNA. The number of long (snoRNAL), short (snoRNASH) and other (that differ from the snoRNAL and snoRNASH) predominant forms of box C/D snoRNAs was determined and plotted relative to binned values of the log2 fold change in expression after the NOP58 KD. The enrichment in snoRNAL downregulated by the KD is shown at bottom. Figure 4. The KD of the RBFOX2 splicing factor preferentially downregulates the expression of short snoRNA forms. (A) KD of RBFOX2 inhibits the expression of select box C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs. RBFOX2 was knocked down in SKOV3ip1 using two independent siRNAs and the impact on the abundance of RNA shorter than 200 nt (snoRNA, miRNA, snRNA, YRNA and tRNA) was calculated relative to the level in mock-transfected cells (LF). The log2 fold change in RNA abundance is shown in the form of scatter plots. The different small RNA members are indicated by blue dots, while the box C/D (left panel) and H/ACA snoRNA (right panel) are highlighted in red. The dashed lines represent a decrease of 2-fold in the RBFOX2 depletion. (B) Effect of the RBFOX2 KD on the different forms of box C/D snoRNA. The number of long (snoRNAL), short (snoRNASH) and other (that differ from the snoRNAL and snoRNASH) forms of box C/D snoRNAs was determined and plotted relative to binned values of the log2 fold change in expression after the RBFOX2 KD. The enrichment in snoRNASH downregulated by the KD is shown at bottom. For form-specific analyses (Figures 1, 2, 3B, 4B, 5 and Supplementary File 1, Figures S3�S9), for any given snoRNA, all sequences differing by as little as 1 nt but present with a count of at least 10 reads were considered as different forms of the same snoRNA. Predominant forms were defined as forms representing at least 20% of the total number of reads mapping to the full-length snoRNAs as defined above (i.e. these reads must cover at least 77% of the full-length snoRNA). The different snoRNA forms were compared to the positions of the boxes C and D as defined in snoRNAbase (28) and sno/scaRNAbase (56). Most box C/D snoRNA sequences start 4�6 nt before the box C and end 2�5 nt after the box D. Short snoRNA forms were defined as sequences starting 4 or 5 nt before the box C and ending 2 to 3 nt after the box D, while long snoRNA forms were defined as sequences starting 5 or 6 nt before the box C and ending 4 or 5 nt after the box D. The abundance of each different snoRNA form was calculated by normalizing the read count corresponding to the form by the total number of reads mapped to the genome for the given sample and multiplying by 1 000 000, obtaining abundance values in count per million (CPM). For all figures analyzing short and long snoRNA forms separately, only predominant forms with a minimum abundance of 1 CPM were considered. The fold change following the NOP58 depletion was calculated as the average normalized abundance for the NOP58 depletions divided by the average normalized abundance in the mock-treated samples. The fold change following the RBFOX2 depletion was calculated using the same procedure. The U3 family members were not considered in the analysis as their length exceeds the size cutoff of 200 nt used to isolate the RNA. Figure 5. NOP58 and RBFOX2 snoRNA targets are form-dependent. The abundance of the different forms generated from each snoRNA was determined before and after the KD of either NOP58 or RBFOX2 and plotted relative to the number of nucleotides upstream of box C and downstream of box D. Shown are three examples representing snoRNAs producing only long (A), only short (B) or both long and short (C) forms. The snoRNA names are shown on top, while the enrichment of the short and long forms are illustrated at bottom. CPM and LF respectively indicate counts per million reads mapped and mock transfection (Lipofectamine). The data obtained after the transfection of two independent siRNAs targeting either NOP58 (blue bars) or RBFOX2 (red bars) and three mock transfections (black bars) are shown. Measurement of the length of the external stem To investigate whether the length of the external stem of snoRNAs differs for short and long snoRNAs, snoRNAs producing only short forms or only long forms were considered separately. The external stem length was calculated as the number of consecutive canonical base pairs and G�U pairs from the k-turn towards the end of the molecule. The maximum stem length considering a k-turn bulge (see Figure 1A) of two and three residues is reported. Northern blot Total RNA was isolated from siRNA-transfected cells grown 48 h using a commercial kit (Qiagen rneasy mini kit). DNase treatment (QIAGEN) was performed. The integrity of the treated RNA was examined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer that calculates the rRNA ratio. Northern blots were performed as described (57) using 15 ?g of total RNA and an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The RNA was visualized by autoradiography using 5?-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes complimentary to the mature sequence of the snoRNA (snR39B: 5?-TGAGTATTCTCTTCATTTCAGGTCA-3?; U31: 5?-CCTTTCAGTCACACATTGATCAGA-3?). The radiolabeled bands were visualized using a Storm 860 scanner (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). RESULTS Many box C/D snoRNAs are overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines To monitor the expression pattern and define the expressed sequence of human snoRNAs without predetermined structural or functional bias, we extracted and sequenced all small RNAs shorter than 200 nt from two immortalized normal fibroblasts (INOF and BJ-Tielf) and two cancer cell lines (ovarian: SKOV3ip1 and breast: MCF7). High-throughput paired-end sequencing of the RNA extracted from two biological replicates of each cell line generated between 15 and 24 million read pairs per sample. The read pairs were processed to remove adapters, controlled for quality and aligned to the human genome as detailed in the Materials and Methods section. Across the four cell lines, between 37% and 56% of the reads mapped to snoRNAs (Table 1), while the rest mapped to other small RNA including tRNA and microRNA. As expected, the read distribution and number of read per transcript were very close for the different biological replicates (Table 1) confirming the quality and reproducibility of the sequencing.

Although this difference in expression levels may be caused by cell-type differences, it seems to be specific to cancer cells since it was also observed between the closely related ovarian fibroblast and serous ovarian cancer cell lines. This increase in the expression of snoRNA is consistent with a large body of literature showing that ribosome production and its associated factors are upregulated in cancers (43,58,59). Interestingly, the opposite trend is seen for orphan snoRNAs which are more abundant in normal cell lines than in cancer cell lines (Supplementary File 1, Figure S3). These data suggest that orphan snoRNAs might play antiproliferative roles in the cell and that cancer can induce both loss and gain of snoRNA functions. The box C/D snoRNAs are expressed in discrete forms with varying ends The analysis of all paired-end reads mapping to full-length snoRNAs reveals that the great majority of box C/D snoRNAs start sharply 4�6 nt upstream from the box C and end between 2 and 5 nt downstream from the box D (Figure 1B). This variation in snoRNA 5? and 3? ends was previously observed but was not further considered and was likely dismissed as processing heterogeneity (14,60). However, close scrutiny of individual snoRNA accumulation profiles suggests non-random distribution of snoRNA 5? and 3? ends. Indeed, sequence analysis reveals the presence of two prevalent forms of C/D snoRNA, a short form (snoRNASH) starting 4 or 5 nt upstream of the box C and finishing 2 or 3 nt downstream from the box D, and a long form (snoRNAL) starting 5 or 6 nt upstream from the box C and ending 4 or 5 nt downstream from the box D (Figure 1C and Supplementary File 1, Figure S4). Most snoRNAs were found expressed either as the short (e.g. U106) or the long form (e.g. HBII-295), while a minority was found expressed as both forms (e.g. U15B) or neither as long nor as short forms (Figure 1C and Supplementary File 1, Figure S4A). These findings were also seen by northern blot for two snoRNAs chosen for validation. U31 is detected only as a short form by RNA-seq and is present as one band by northern blot, and snR39B is detected as both a long and a short form by RNA-seq and is present as two bands by northern blot (Supplementary File 1, Figures S5 and S6). This snoRNA-specific distribution of 5? and 3? ends suggests that the difference between snoRNA forms is generated through specific processing pathways and not random processing heterogeneity. Indeed, the exact snoRNA forms are well conserved across the four cell lines considered regardless of their tissular origin and proliferative potential (Supplementary File 1, Figure S4B). Extension of snoRNA 5? and 3? ends increases the stability of the external stem structure To understand the relevance of the different snoRNA forms, we investigated their structural and functional differences and their impact if any on the basic features of box C/D snoRNA. As summarized in Figure 2A, no significant differences between the long and short forms were found in the consensus sequences of boxes C and D, or in their k-turn characteristics as defined in Figure 1A. However, the external stem, which is expected to increase the stability of the k-turn motif and believed to be important for canonical snoRNP assembly (17,61,62), is significantly shorter in snoRNASH (P-value < 10?4 by Kolmogorov�Smirnov goodness-of-fit test). As shown in Figure 2B and C, while 30% of snoRNAs produced only as short forms have no external stem (i.e. 0 or 1 consecutive paired residues in this region), over 75% of snoRNAs produced only as long forms have a stem of over five base pairs and many extend well passed the end of the actual mature snoRNA (but are present in the genomic DNA and could be present as long stems before the snoRNA is excised and processed from the intron). Thermodynamic analyses using mfold (63) on a small number of snoRNAs produced as both long and short forms indicate that the longer forms have an average 4 kcal/mol lower free energy than the shorter forms, when folding to form k-turns (e.g. compare Supplementary File1, Figure S7A and B, D and E as well as G and H). The short forms are often more likely to fold in a way that maximizes canonical base pairing, but makes k-turn formation unlikely (e.g. Supplementary File 1, Figure S7C, F and I). Therefore, the long snoRNA forms are more likely to preserve the structure of the k-turn motif needed for the assembly of core snoRNA proteins, such as NOP58, than the short form. Depletion of NOP58 preferentially inhibits the expression of the box"
Breast_Cancer "C/D snoRNA long form Since the snoRNA forms appear to exhibit differences in the stability of the k-turn motif required for the assembly of the NOP58 associated protein complex, we investigated the impact of depleting this protein on the abundance of the different snoRNA forms. NOP58 is essential for the accumulation and stability of canonical box C/D snoRNAs (16,21,64,65) and thus its depletion should inhibit the expression of all box C/D snoRNAs. Accordingly, NOP58 was knocked down in the ovarian cancer model cell line SKOV3ip1 using two independent siRNAs and the resulting RNA was sequenced and compared to that extracted from mock-transfected cells. As expected, box H/ACA snoRNAs, miRNAs and tRNAs, which do not interact with NOP58, were not affected by the KD of NOP58 (Figure 3A). A subset of 13 box C/D snoRNAs are strongly affected by the KD of NOP58 (overall decrease in abundance of more than 2-fold following NOP58 depletion, considering all forms of the snoRNA together). However, a significant proportion of box C/D snoRNAs are not strongly affected by the KD of NOP58. The effect of the NOP58 depletion is better understood when snoRNAL and snoRNASH are considered separately. The abundance distributions of snoRNAL and snoRNASH are significantly different following the depletion of NOP58 (P-value < 10?8 by one-tailed Kolmogorov�Smirnov test) and while most of the long snoRNA forms are affected by the NOP58 KD, the majority of the short forms are not (Figure 3B). Indeed, the expression of over 70% of snoRNASH is either increased or not affected by the NOP58 depletion, while the expression of 63% of snoRNAL is downregulated by 1.5-fold or more. Forty-five snoRNA forms are negatively affected more than 2-fold in the NOP58 depletion (listed in Supplementary File 1, Figure S8). The small number of other box C/D snoRNA forms that do not correspond to the definition of either the short or long forms did not show preferential NOP58 effects. The great majority of these other snoRNAs are either at least as short if not shorter than the snoRNASH for both of their ends, or at least as long if not longer than the snoRNAL for both of their ends. The form-specific effect of the NOP58 depletion was confirmed by northern blot for snR39B, which is expressed as both a long and a short form. Corroborating the results obtained by RNA-seq analysis, northern blot analysis showed the long form to be negatively affected by the NOP58 KD while the short form is unaffected (Supplementary File 1, Figure S5). Collectively, these data indicate that NOP58 is important for the stability of some but not all box C/D snoRNAs and that snoRNAs most strongly affected by the depletion of NOP58 are predominantly produced with long ends. The RNA binding protein RBFOX2 is required for the expression of some short form snoRNA The insensitivity of snoRNASH to NOP58 depletion suggests that this group of snoRNAs uses a different or partially altered set of protein factors to form a stable snoRNA complex. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of proteins implicated in RNA processing and stability on snoRNASH expression by KD of these proteins. Surprisingly, out of eight different ribonucleases and RNA binding proteins tested (single KD of NOP58, RBFOX2, QKI, Drosha, Dicer and DGCR8, as well as double KD of XRN1 and XRN2, as well as of DDX47 and EXOSC10), only NOP58 and RBFOX2 showed a significant and widespread snoRNA-specific effect (Figures 3 and 4 and data not shown). RBFOX2 is a splicing factor (66�70) that is not considered to be a component of the canonical snoRNP complex but instead was shown to physically interact with and stabilize the precursors of the large HBII-85 box C/D snoRNA family (44). As shown in Figure 4A, the RBFOX2 depletion reduced the expression of a specific subset of box C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs without affecting the overall expression levels of most small RNAs. Interestingly, in complete opposite to the NOP58 depletion shown in Figure 3B, the RBFOX2 depletion preferentially decreases the abundance of snoRNASH (Figure 4B). Once again, snoRNAL and snoRNASH display significantly different abundance distributions following the depletion of RBFOX2 (P-value < 10?8 by one-tailed Kolmogorov�Smirnov test). The C/D snoRNAs with forms most strongly affected by the depletion of RBFOX2 are shown in Supplementary File 1, Figure S9. Close scrutiny of individual snoRNA forms indicates that the great majority are either affected by the RBFOX2 or NOP58 depletions or affected by neither, but very few are affected by both (for examples see Figure 5). In general, NOP58 affects snoRNA producing the long form (e.g. HBII-82, Figure 5A), while RBFOX2 affects snoRNA producing the short form (e.g. U84, Figure 5B). Strikingly, in the case of snoRNAs expressing both short and long forms, the NOP58 KD typically affects specifically only the long form, while the RBFOX2 depletion only affects the short form (e.g. U26 in Figure 5C). Three box C/D snoRNAs expressing both a long form strongly affected by the depletion of NOP58 and a short form strongly affected by the depletion of RBFOX2 were identified: U15B, U26 and SNORD126. The analysis of their predicted secondary structure (Supplementary File 1, Figure S7) indicates that the minimum free energy of the long form with likely k-turn formation is on average 3.9 +/?0.8 kcal/mol lower than the minimum free energy of the short form with likely k-turn formation. In all three cases, other predicted secondary structures of the short form were also predicted with strong canonical pairing in the box C and box D region and lower minimum free energy than the short k-turn form (Supplementary File 1, Figure S7), suggesting that the short forms are more likely to fold maximizing the canonical pairing than favoring the k-turn formation. We conclude that the differences between the forms of box C/D snoRNAs alter their protein interactions and possibly the nature of their mature snoRNP complex. NOP58 and RBFOX2 affect snoRNAs with different structure and genomic position The distinct effects of NOP58 and RBFOX2 on box C/D snoRNA suggest that snoRNAs displaying different genomic characteristics may form snoRNP complexes with distinct protein requirement. To further examine this possibility, we compared the genomic location and precursor structure of NOP58- and RBFOX2-dependent snoRNAs. In accordance with results described above, only 39% of the individual forms affected by the NOP58 depletion are short, while 95% of those affected by the RBFOX2 depletion are short (Supplementary File 1, Figure S10). This indicates that these proteins affect distinct subsets of box C/D snoRNAs. In general, NOP58-sensitive snoRNAs display higher count and form diversity than those affected by RBFOX2 (Supplementary File 1, Figures S7�S9). This supports the more general role of NOP58 in snoRNA biogenesis and suggests that RBFOX2 has more specialized functions affecting a small subset of snoRNA. In addition, NOP58 and RBFOX2 appear to affect snoRNAs produced via different processing pathways. NOP58-dependent snoRNAs typically form a strong terminal stem extending within the intronic sequence and are located in close proximity (<150 nt) to the nearest downstream exon, both characteristics of snoRNAs produced through the canonical processing pathway (18). In contrast, 71% of snoRNAs affected by the depletion of RBFOX2 either have short or no terminal stems (< = 4bp) or are found more than 150 nt away from the nearest downstream exon (Supplementary File 1, Figure S10 right column). Overall, the data suggest that the majority of RBFOX2- and NOP58-dependent snoRNAs have different structural requirements for processing and biogenesis. DISCUSSION Classical approaches for the study of snoRNA structure and function (e.g. northern blot, low-throughput sequencing of individual snoRNAs) have led us to believe that a given snoRNA is always recognized in the same way and processed/bound by the same interactors, generating a single functional molecule. In contrast, the genome scale analysis of snoRNA presented here suggests otherwise. Box C/D snoRNAs are produced as specific and distinct forms that are conserved in different cell lines (Figure 1 and Supplementary File 1, Figure S4) and affected by different factors (Figures 3 and 4), which cannot be explained by stochastic differences in processing events. Indeed, comparison between normal and cancer cell lines indicates that while snoRNAs are generally overexpressed in cancer, their processing pattern and the relative form distribution is highly conserved (Figure 1 and Supplementary File 1, Figures S3 and S4). Most box C/D snoRNAs detected in this study are found in one of two forms: (i) the long form, which consists of snoRNAs starting between 5 and 6 nt before the box C and ending between 4 and 5 nt after the box D and (ii) the short form, which is defined as snoRNAs starting 4 or 5 nt before the box C and ending 2 or 3 nt after the box D. The long forms are more likely to display canonical snoRNA features, such as long terminal stems, location near the 3? splice site of the host intron and dependency on core snoRNA binding proteins (e.g. NOP58). In contrast, most short snoRNAs are NOP58 independent, fewer have validated targets and a subset requires non-core snoRNA binding proteins like RBFOX2 for expression. These observations indicate that snoRNAs are expressed in subclasses with varying processing and functional preference and underscore the importance of the 5? and 3? end sequences for snoRNA biogenesis and function. The sequence and functions of most snoRNAs are conserved but their genomic location and expression patterns vary between species. In yeast most snoRNAs are transcribed from independent promoters, while in human they are excised from the introns of host genes (71). Studies using model snoRNAs have shown that the processing pathways of intronic snoRNAs depend on their location within the host gene (18,72,73). snoRNAs located ?75 nt upstream of a 3? splice site are efficiently processed in a splicing-dependent manner, while those further upstream require extended terminal stems for splicing-independent processing (18,72,73). Consistently, the results of this study indicate that all but four of the 45 snoRNAs following the canonical processing pathway, as judged by their dependency on NOP58, are either near the 3? splice site, possess an extended terminal stem or exhibit both features (Supplementary Data File 2). In contrast, snoRNAs that do not exhibit these canonical features do not require NOP58 and instead some require the expression of the splicing factor RBFOX2. Many snoRNAs have previously been found bound to RBFOX2 suggesting that RBFOX2 might affect their maturation. Indeed, an RBFOX2 cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) dataset (70) identified many reads mapping to snoRNAs (Supplementary File 1, Figure S11). The interaction between RBFOX2 and snoRNAs appears to be specific since a much larger proportion of CLIP-seq reads map to snoRNAs than to mRNAs or even miRNAs, which originate from precursors of a size similar to snoRNAs and like snoRNAs, are also highly abundant (Supplementary File 1, Figure S11). Furthermore, one of the most strongly enriched RBFOX2 consensus sequences, GUGAUG, (70) resembles the sequence of the box C (RUGAUGA). It is not clear at this stage whether RBFOX2 forms a stable complex with snoRNAs or transiently binds these snoRNAs during splicing and biogenesis. However, unlike NOP58, RBFOX2-dependent snoRNAs are more likely to be located away from splice sites (Supplementary File 1, Figure S10) and thus do not overlap with the regions harboring the RBFOX2 binding motifs affecting the splicing decision (70). In addition, RBFOX2-dependent snoRNAs are not enriched in introns flanking RBFOX2-regulated exons (data not shown). Together these observations suggest that the regulatory role of RBFOX2 in alternative splicing is not strictly linked to its role in snoRNA biogenesis. The data obtained in this study suggest a snoRNA processing model (Figure 6) where snoRNAs forming a k-turn motif stabilized by a long terminal stem, and typically located close to a 3? splice site, are likely to bind to the NOP58 complex leading to the formation of canonical snoRNPs that mostly target rRNA for modification. In cases where the k-turn is unstable (e.g. snoRNASH) and the snoRNA is positioned further upstream from the 3? splice site, binding of the NOP58 complex becomes less efficient, making the snoRNA available for association with other protein factors like RBFOX2. According to this model, non-canonical snoRNAs that do not have conventional targets or activity are more likely to be generated by an alternative processing mechanism independent of the snoRNP core proteins that obligatorily associate with NOP58. This group of non-canonical snoRNAs may include those serving as precursors for miRNAs or involved in rRNA independent functions such as splicing regulation and chromatin modulation (30,32,35�37,74�76). Many of these snoRNAs are not affected by either NOP58 or RBFOX2 depletions, suggesting that other protein factors might be involved in forming specific subclasses of snoRNAs. Detailed analysis of the effects of different RNA binding proteins on snoRNA may shed light on the breadth and depth of the snoRNA super family. Meanwhile, the data presented here provide a clear example of snoRNA subclasses and challenges the notion that all box C/D snoRNAs are obligatorily dependent on core snoRNA binding proteins. Figure 6. Intronic snoRNA processing model. (A) Intronic snoRNAs displaying canonical features including a strong k-turn and/or proximity to the downstream exon are more likely to follow the canonical processing pathway including dependency on core box C/D snoRNP proteins such as NOP58. (B) In contrast, snoRNAs displaying non-canonical features are more likely to depend on non-canonical snoRNA binding proteins such as RBFOX2.

Breast_Cancer "We developed cMethDNA, a quantitative multiplexed methylation-specific PCR assay for a panel of ten genes, consisting of novel and known breast cancer hypermethylated markers identified by mining our previously reported study of DNA methylation patterns in breast tissue (103 cancer, 21 normal on the Illumina HumanMethylation27 Beadchip) and then validating the 10-gene panel in a TCGA breast cancer methylome database. For cMethDNA, a fixed physiological level (50 copies) of artificially constructed, standard non-human reference DNA specific for each gene is introduced into in a constant volume of serum (300 ?l) prior to purification of the DNA, facilitating a sensitive, specific, robust and quantitative assay of tumor DNA, with broad dynamic range. Cancer-specific methylated DNA was detected in Training (28 normal, 24 cancer) and Test (27 normal, 33 cancer) sets of recurrent Stage 4 patient sera with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 96% in the test set. In a pilot study, cMethDNA assay faithfully reflected patient response to chemotherapy (N = 29). A core methylation signature present in the primary breast cancer was retained in serum and metastatic tissues collected at autopsy 2�11 years after diagnosis of the disease. Together, our data suggest that the cMethDNA assay can detect advanced breast cancer, and monitor tumor burden and treatment response in women with metastatic breast cancer. breast markers methylation blood tumor Med Sci Monit Med.

All previous studies demonstrating this seasonality were performed in European populations residing at latitudes upwards of 50�N. This study investigated whether seasonality of prognosis persists in populations residing in the lower latitudes of the contiguous United States (Latitude 21�N to 48�N). Material/Methods The 5-year survival data of 19 204 female breast cancer, 6740 colorectal cancer, and 1644 prostate cancer cases was analyzed. Results Female breast cancer patients exhibited improved survival when diagnosed in the summer as compared to the winter at all latitudes (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.940, 95%; Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.938 to 0.941, P=0.002). Colorectal cancer and prostate cancer also exhibited a similar seasonal pattern (HR: 0.978, 95% CI: 0.975 to 0.980, P=0.008 and HR: 0.935, 95%, CI 0.929 to 0.943, P=0.006), respectively, when the analysis was restricted to northern regions. Conclusions These observations contribute to the mounting evidence that vitamin D3 may affect the progression of cancer. Data also suggest that vitamin D3 status at the onset of treatment may synergistically improve the prognosis of several cancer types. MeSH Keywords Latitude Vitamin D Breast Neoplasms Prostatic Neoplasms Colonic Neoplasms Background Vitamin D is involved in a number of processes that are essential for healthy body functions. It helps to improve muscle strength and immune function and reduces many of the inflammatory processes within our bodies. Vitamin D is also known to promote the absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and to maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphate needed for bone formation, mineralization, growth, and repair. Evidence supporting the protective function of vitamin D3 against many forms of cancer is mounting. A large number of ecological studies have observed that cancer incidence and mortality rates correlate inversely with vitamin D status [1�8]. A recent review by Grant comprehensively outlines the work, to date, that has been completed in the field [9]. Although the cancer-protective mechanism of vitamin D3 is not fully understood, its actions are likely to involve the activation of the vitamin D receptors (VDR). It has been well established that activated VDR modifies cell function both genomically and non-genomically [10]. VDR has been shown to exhibit tumor-suppressing and differentiation-inducing activities [11]. Promotion of apoptosis as well as inhibition of angiogenesis and metastatic potential has also been attributed to VDR [10,11]. In addition, Vitamin D3 has been observed to act synergistically with several chemotherapeutic agents [12�17]. VDR expression is known to increase during the development of breast, colon, and prostate cancers, suggesting that these cancer types may be particularly susceptible to vitamin D treatment [18]. Most people get the vitamin D they need through sunlight exposure. It can also be obtained through the diet, but very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Previous studies have demonstrated that for several forms of cancer, the season of diagnosis may influence cancer survival rates [19�21]. Individuals diagnosed in the summer or autumn months, where most individuals are outdoors during the longer days, were found to have a survival advantage over those diagnosed in the winter or spring months. Many of the studies linking cancer survival and season of diagnosis were performed in European populations residing at latitudes above 50�N [19�21]. To our knowledge, no studies have demonstrated the same seasonal pattern of cancer survival in the lower latitudes of the contiguous United States (24�N to 49�N). Using the National Cancer Institute�s SEER*Stat SEER 17 database, this study investigated any association between seasonality and prognosis in cancers of the female breast, colon, rectum, and prostate. Material and Methods Cancer survival data The National Cancer Institute compiles data covering 26% of the US population. The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database, a subset of the National Cancer Institute, contains cancer incidence and survival data from 17 geographic regions reporting between the years 1973 to 2008 [22]. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate observed survival for female breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers using the National Cancer Institute�s SEER*Stat version 7.0.5. Inclusion criteria included all malignant cases diagnosed in Atlanta (Metropolitan), Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San Francisco-Oakland SMSA, Seattle, and Utah between 1973 and 2002. Cases were included only if the cancer of diagnosis was also the cause of death. Skin vitamin D3 production decreases with age [23]; therefore, individuals 50 and older are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form; therefore, the subject age range was limited to 50�64 years of age for colorectal and prostate cancer. Menopausal status was an additional consideration for the breast cancer age selection. Since the SEER*Stat database does not collect menopausal status data, a post-menopausal population was approximated by selecting for females 50 to 64 years of age, as per SEER*Stat recommendations [23]. All non-white races were excluded as well as SEER regions that began data collection between 1992 and 2000. UVB data The most populous city within the each SEER region was used to estimate average UVB irradiation in that region. The only exception is for SEER region �Connecticut - 1973+� because UV Index (UVI) data could not be obtained for the city of Bridgeport, CT. For �Connecticut ? 1973+�, Hartford, CT, was used instead for both UVB. UVI data was obtained for each region for the year 1995 (the earliest year for which complete annual data was available) from the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [24]. NOAA computes UVI using forecasted ozone data, a radioactive transfer model, forecasted cloud amounts, climatological aerosol loading, variable snow and bare earth albedo, as well as elevation [24]. UVB irradiation, ranging from 280 to 315 nm, was calculated from UVI data using the following relationship: UVB280-315(W�m-2)=18.9�UVI.[ 25] Daily UVB irradiation data was used to calculate summer and winter irradiation averages for each SEER region. Summer was defined as June 1 to July 31 and winter was defined as December 1 to February 28. The peak seasonal irradiation averages were used to calculate summer-to-winter ratios of UVB irradiation (S: W ratios). Latitude data Latitude of the most populous city in each SEER region was obtained from the US Census Bureau [26]. For SEER region �Connecticut ? 1973+�, Hartford, CT, was used in lieu of Bridgeport due to the absence of UVI data for Bridgeport. Statistical analysis A log rank test was performed on the Kaplan-Meier observed survival data. Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze each cancer type for variation in 5-year survival, stratified by season of diagnosis. Seasons were defined as follows: winter is December 1 to February 28; spring is March 1 to May 31; summer is June 1 to July 31; and fall is September 1 to November 30. Survival of each season was compared to that of winter. All aforementioned SEER regions were included in the primary analysis of each cancer. For cancer types that did not exhibit seasonality, secondary analyses were performed after controlling for latitude. A series of intermediate analyses were performed in which minimum latitude was progressively elevated in a step-wise fashion. The minimum latitude was initially set at 37�N. For each analysis in the series, only SEER regions located at or above the minimum latitude would be included in the sample. For the final analysis of colorectal cancer, SEER regions located at 42.2�N latitude and above were included for analysis. Prostate cancer regions were restricted to those located at 47.6�N. A ratio of the average summer time to winter time peak irradiances was calculated (S: W ratio). Simple linear regression was performed between S: W ratio and latitudes of SEER regions were included in the analysis. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc, 2012, La Jolla, CA). Results For breast cancer analysis, when all SEER regions were included, 19 204 cases met our inclusion criteria with 24.15% (4638) cases diagnosed in the winter, 25.69% (4934) cases diagnosed in the spring, 25.49% (4895) cases diagnosed in the summer, and 24.67% (4737) cases diagnosed in the fall. Hazard ratios for each season of diagnosis are displayed in Table 1. Female breast cancer cases diagnosed in the summer (HR: 0.940, 95% CI: 0.938 to 0.941, P=0.002) showed a significant survival advantage over those diagnosed in the winter. No difference in survival was observed between cases diagnosed in the winter compared to spring (HR: 0.993, 95% CI: 0.990 to 0.995, P=0.70) nor winter compared to fall (HR: 0.992, 95% CI: 0.989 to 0.994, P=0.70). When similar analyses were performed for colorectal cancer and prostate cancer, a seasonality pattern of cancer survival was not observed. Simple linear regression demonstrated that S: W ratio and latitude are positively correlated (slope: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.31, R2: 0.93) (Figure 1). Puget Sound (Seattle), located at the highest latitude of all SEER regions (47.62�N), exhibited the greatest summer-to-winter differential (S: W ratio 8.07). Hawaii, located at the lowest latitude (21.32�N), was calculated to have the lowest S: W ratio (S: W ratio 1.83). All calculated S: W ratios are shown in Table 2. A total of 6740 patients met the inclusion criteria for the colorectal cancer analysis. Of this total, 24.70% (1665) were diagnosed in the winter, 25.83% (1741) in the spring, 25.27% (1703) in the summer, and 24.20% (1631) in the fall. The colorectal cancer subjects from regions between 42.2�N and 47.6�N exhibited improved survival when diagnosed in the summer as compared to the winter (HR: 0.978, 95% CI: 0.975 to 0.980, P=0.008) (Table 3). In addition, significant improvements in survival were also observed in the spring and fall groups as compared to the winter (HR: 0.984, 95% CI: 0.980 to 0.987, P=0.004; HR: 0.991, 95% CI: 0.987 to 0.993, P<0.0001, respectively). Hazard ratios for each season of diagnosis for colorectal cancer analyses are summarized in Table 3. The S: W ratio in the regions analyzed ranged from 6.9 to 8.1. For the prostate cancer analysis, 1644 subjects met the selection criteria, with 23.26% (384) cases being diagnosed in the winter, 26.28% (432) in the spring, 23.54% (387) in the summer, and 26.82% (441) in the fall. Prostate cancer cases did not exhibit a similar survival seasonality until the latitude was limited to 47.6�N (HR: 0.935, 95% CI 0.929 to 0.943, P=0.006) (Table 3). No significant differences in survival were observed between spring and winter (HR: 1.035, 95% CI: 1.028 to 1.042, P=0.15) or fall and winter (HR: 1.004, 95% CI: 0.997 to 1.011, P=0.87) for prostate cancer diagnoses. Hazard ratios for prostate cancer analyses are shown in Table 3. "
Breast_Cancer "At the latitude of analysis, the S: W ratio was calculated to be 8.1. Discussion Previous studies have shown that abnormal regulation of adhesion proteins such as Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and subsequently increased beta-catenin expression is involved in the proliferation and growth of colon cancer cells. However, many of these studies did not investigate whether the down-regulation of beta-catenin in colon cancer may result in compromised invasion and migration in vitro. [27]. In this current study, when all SEER regions were taken into account, females diagnosed with breast cancer in the summer exhibited significantly improved 5-year survival compared to females diagnosed in the winter. This finding is consistent with the results of several similar studies undertaken in European populations [18,28]. Recent studies have suggested that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) acts as a promoter of metastasis in breast cancer, although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. E-cadherin (E-cad) adhesion protein seems to be a potential target of miR-10b. Yong Liu et al. state that the existence of a novel E-cadherin-related mechanism by which miR-10b modulates breast cancer metastasis exists and that miR-10b may be a useful biomarker of advanced progression and metastasis of breast cancer [29]. A recent study, using data extracted from the SEER database, did not show any overall seasonality in cumulative probability of death from breast cancer [30]. Interestingly, a seasonal variation in tumor stage at the time of diagnosis was detected by the authors, with spring having the highest proportion of localized tumors. Cancers such as breast cancer are under hormonal control and therefore highly influenced by fluctuating menstrual hormones in pre-menopausal women [31]. These hormone-positive tumors can be age-specific and are under the control of receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR). In addition to this cyclical variance in menstrual hormones, breast cancer ER and PgR expression has been demonstrated to exhibit circannual rhythmicity [31]. ER and PgR expression reaches a nadir during the spring season [32�36], which explains the localized restriction of tumor growth seen during spring in a previous study [30]. Because 50%�80% of invasive breast cancers are hormone-responsive [37], the complex interactions between rhythmic hormone and hormone receptor levels may have concealed any seasonal survival patterns caused by vitamin D3 production. Consistent with this hypothesis are observations that breast cancers diagnosed pre-menopausally can exhibit seasonality of prognosis, but only in receptor-negative cancers [38]. Studies have also shown that the capacity for UVB-stimulated cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis declines with advancing age [22]. In a study investigating the seasonality of prostate cancer survival, although all age groups exhibited improved survival when cancer was diagnosed in the summer, the greatest improvement was seen in the youngest age group [20]. Thus, failure to adjust for the advanced age of subjects during analysis may obscure the effects of vitamin D3 on seasonal survival. In the current study, to control for menstruation-related hormonal variance, a post-menopausal population was selected for analysis. The decline and cessation of ovarian hormonal synthesis may cause the effects of other hormones on breast cancer survival to become more apparent [37]. Additionally, by limiting subject age to a maximum of 64 years, we attempted to exclude individuals who may have impaired vitamin D3 synthesis [20]. The age limits used in the current study may explain the observed seasonal pattern of breast cancer survival that was absent in the Stajner study [30]. Similar analyses based on all combined SEER regions did not demonstrate seasonality of prognosis for colorectal and prostate cancers. Previous studies observed a link between the survival rate of various cancers and season of diagnosis. These studies, however, were performed in regions located at more northerly latitudes than the contiguous United States, such as Norway [19,20] and the United Kingdom [21] (Table 4). The large solar zenith angles (SZA) associated with winter at high latitudes result in an increased amount of UVB absorption by the ozone layer [39]. Cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis relies on the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 by solar UVB290�315 nm radiation [40]. In regions located above 37�N latitude, during late fall and winter (November to February) UVB irradiation is attenuated by amounts upwards of 80%, limiting the potential for vitamin D3 synthesis [41]. Conversely, at latitudes below approximately 37�N, vitamin D3 can be reliably produced throughout the year [39,41]. Because these high latitudes exhibit a large disparity between summer and winter UVB irradiation levels, summer and winter vitamin D3 levels of residents of those regions are also likely to vary greatly. It follows that the relatively low latitude of the United States would not provide a sufficient difference in UVR and, consequently, vitamin D3 levels between summer and winter to produce any seasonality patterns for survival for all types of cancers. To examine regions with the greatest differential between summer and winter UVB irradiation levels, only regions located at higher latitudes (above 37�N) were included in secondary analyses. Significant survival advantages were observed for colorectal and prostate cancers diagnosed during the summer at latitudes above 42.4�N and at 47.6�N, respectively. The S: W ratio of UVB irradiation correlated linearly with latitude. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin D3 status at the time of diagnosis may improve cancer survival. Of the 3 cancer types investigated in the current study, the effects of seasonality were most pronounced in the female breast cancer group. Several other authors have previously commented on this trend [18,21,43,44] but no explanatory hypothesis has been proposed. The tumor-suppressing and differentiation-inducing actions of VDR have been generalized to many cancer types [11]."
Breast_Cancer "Specific mechanisms for the suppressions of breast cancer have also been attributed to VDR [10,45,44]. Activated VDR has been demonstrated to down-regulate ER synthesis and ER activity [10,45]. As previously mentioned, ER and PgR exhibit circannual rhythmicity and a pattern of rhythmicity persists even after menopause [31,36]. Because hormone receptor concentrations are fundamental predictors of breast cancer outcome, the interaction between the rhythmicity of vitamin D3 and the rhythmicity of ER may be important in recognizing the strength of the relationship between female breast cancer and seasonality of prognosis. After diagnosis and treatment, many women seek breast reconstruction as a means of maintaining aesthetic beauty. The internal mammary artery and vein are often used as sites of anastomoses in microvascular breast reconstruction because this area supports lymphatic drainage of the breast. However, its role in breast cancer metastasis remains unclear. Christoph Andree et al. concluded that the internal mammary lymphatic drainage system is an important and often underappreciated pathway for breast cancer metastasis. Their findings indicate that routine sampling of these lymph nodes at the time of microvascular breast reconstruction is easy to perform and is a useful tool for identifying women who might require additional treatment and to increase cancer-free survival. [46] The present study has several limitations, including limitations of the data available from the SEER database. Factors that may affect vitamin D status but could not be controlled for in this study include vitamin D dietary intake [2,48], obesity [2,48], physical activity, alcohol consumption [2], smoking [2], and socioeconomic status [2]. These limitations accounted for the inconsistency in results between the findings in the literature because of the challenges of conducting studies observing individual behaviors. Measuring blood levels of vitamin D avoids some of the limitations of assessing dietary intake. However, vitamin D levels in the blood vary by race, with the season (as discussed within this review), and possibly with the activity of genes whose products are involved in vitamin D transport and metabolism. These variations complicate the interpretation of studies that measure the concentration of vitamin D in serum at a single point in time. The use of S: W ratio may also have limited interpretation value. The ratio was a convenient method to calculate a crude estimation of the difference in seasonal UVB irradiation of each region. The actual irradiance experienced by individuals residing in each region is highly influenced by their individual behaviors [20]. Although studies in the past have used SCC as a measure of UV exposure [18,20,29], SCC incidence data was not available. Finally, the limited geographic distribution of SEER regions restricted the population available for sampling when latitude was being controlled for. Seasonality for colorectal cancer survival was observed when the 2 most northerly SEER regions were included for analysis, while prostate cancer survival seasonality was observed in the most northerly SEER region. Because SEER regions are only located in the contiguous US, the maximum latitude for which there is data is 48�N, excluding Alaska. Conclusions Vitamin D is involved in a number of processes that are essential for healthy body functions. It helps to improve muscle strength and immune function and reduces many of the inflammatory processes within our bodies. Vitamin D is also known to promote the absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and to maintain adequate blood levels of the calcium and phosphate needed for bone formation, mineralization, growth, and repair. Many ecological studies have observed that cancer incidence and mortality rates correlate inversely with vitamin D3 status [1�8]. Individuals living in southern latitudes were found to have lower rates of incidence and death for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers than those living at northern latitudes. Because sunlight/UV exposure is necessary for the production of vitamin D3, it was hypothesized that variation in vitamin D levels accounted for the observed relationships. Other investigators have also demonstrated that in several European populations season of diagnosis is a prognostic factor for many cancer types [19�21]. Evidence-based studies done in laboratory settings have shown an association with the possible cancer-protective role for vitamin D. They suggested that vitamin D promoted the differentiation and death of cancer cells, or slowed their proliferation. This study observes seasonality of cancer prognosis in the US using data obtained from the SEER database. The observations from this study suggested that the seasonality of cancer prognosis is latitude-dependent. The findings of this study are consistent with the accumulating evidence supporting the role of vitamin D3 as a protective agent against several forms of cancer.

Breast_Cancer "Background. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among females with a high mortality rate. It is essential to classify the estrogen receptor based breast cancer subtypes into correct subclasses, so that the right treatments can be applied to lower the mortality rate. Using gene signatures derived from gene interaction networks to classify breast cancers has proven to be more reproducible and can achieve higher classification performance. However, the interactions in the gene interaction network usually contain many false-positive interactions that do not have any biological meanings. Therefore, it is a challenge to incorporate the reliability assessment of interactions when deriving gene signatures from gene interaction networks. How to effectively extract gene signatures from available resources is critical to the success of cancer classification. Methods. We propose a novel method to measure and extract the reliable (biologically true or valid) interactions from gene interaction networks and incorporate the extracted reliable gene interactions into our proposed RRHGE algorithm to identify significant gene signatures from microarray gene expression data for classifying ER+ and ER? breast cancer samples. Results. The evaluation on real breast cancer samples showed that our RRHGE algorithm achieved higher classification accuracy than the existing approaches. 1. Introduction The diagnosis or prognosis of cancer is believed as one of the most significant research areas in the bioinformatics field. Traditionally, cancer classification is solely based on clinical evidence and requires pathological expertise for biological interpretation. A major challenge in clinical cancer research is the accurate classification of cancers for improving prognosis and treatment. With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, researchers and biologists have generated a massive amount of data at different levels, such as gene expression profiles using microarrays [1], protein-protein interactions (PPI) [2, 3], gene ontology terms [4], and pathways [5]. These biological data make it possible for biologists and researchers to find solutions to various biological questions of interest, such as the diagnosis of breast cancer by identifying cancer-associated genes. Due to the increasing use of microarray technology that obtains expression levels of all genes simultaneously, a set of gene expression markers (also known as gene signatures) can be used to diagnose breast cancer in a comprehensive manner [6]. However, existing gene signatures do show variable performances across datasets which makes the classification results unstable [7]. Due to the heterogeneous nature of existing gene signatures, many patients have been classified into the wrong breast cancer subtype and treated with unnecessary adjuvant therapy (chemo or radiation therapy). To solve this problem, various microarray data based breast cancer classification methods have been proposed that use statistical and machine-learning methods for the molecular classification of breast cancer [7�10]. Van de Vijver et al. [11] developed the 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) that classifies breast cancer patients into good or poor prognosis groups. Wang et al. [12] developed a 76-gene signature that consists of 60 genes for the ER+ (estrogen receptor-positive) group and 16 genes for the ER? (estrogen receptor-negative) group in order to classify and to predict the distant metastasis of breast cancer. It was observed that the gene signatures generated in these studies were not robust and heavily depended on the chosen training set [13]. In order to derive the gene signatures from the microarray data and to accurately uncover the molecular forms of breast cancer, plus use the gene signatures for various clinical purposes, the robustness and biological meaning of gene signatures are equally essential [7]. Chuang et al. [14] indicate that a disease like cancer originates from the driver genes that progressively change the expressions of greater amplitude in genes that participate (or interacts) with the driver gene (also called mutations). For the classification of breast cancer, it is therefore good to incorporate the gene network based approach for the following reasons: (1) the gene networks provide models of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer; (2) the detected subnetworks from a gene network are comparatively more reproducible across different breast cancer cohorts than traditional individual genes selected without consideration of network related information; and (3) the gene network based approach achieves higher accuracy in classifying breast cancer subtypes [14]. Various network based approaches have been proposed for microarray data analysis. Gill et al. [15] constructed the condition-dependent networks from differential gene expression with no prior interaction information used (such as PPI or gene regulatory information), which limits the biological validation of their results [7]. Chuang et al. [14] proposed the network based approach that detects differentially expressed subnetworks from the existing PPI data by making use of the local subnetworks aggregation. A network based algorithm (ITI) has been proposed by Garcia et al. [7] that identifies the subnetwork based gene signatures generalizable over multiple and heterogeneous microarray datasets by making use of the PPI data incorporated with the gene expression datasets. These existing network based approaches address the biological question of interest to some extent. However, these approaches have some issues associated with them, for example: (1) the classifier performance is largely affected by the dataset size [7]; (2) the curse of dimensionality issue (too few samples (in the order of hundreds) for too many genes (in the order of tens of thousands)) is not considered carefully and still needs to be resolved [7]; and, most importantly, (3) the existing PPI datasets such as DIP [16] and HPRD [17] contain many false-positive interactions (i.e., interactions identified by experiments but actually never happen) [18]. Therefore, the existing approaches that use PPI datasets in discovering knowledge or biological facts (such as breast cancer classification, distant metastasis prediction) may be distorted or biased. The HRGE algorithm [19] tried to address the above issues by identifying hub gene subnetworks and figuring out gene signatures to classify ER+ and ER? breast cancer. However, for HRGE, the reliability weights are empirical when they are incorporated into the algorithm to construct gene signatures. Therefore, the classification results are not stable for some cases. A stable and robust statistic model is required to determine the reliability weights. Furthermore, no independent testing datasets were used when the effectiveness of the HRGE algorithm was evaluated, and no biological validations were conducted as well. The identification and the extraction of reliable protein interactions from the original experimental PPI datasets is becoming one of the most significant and challenging tasks when using the PPI data for biological analyses. Therefore, to resolve the above issues when classifying cancers, it is essential to develop a novel network based breast cancer classifier which maximises the reliable information for the interactions in the network and is able to provide the optimal classification performance across datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel subnetwork based breast cancer classification approach to distinguish two subtypes of breast cancer, that is, ER+ and ER?. To increase the sample size of the study and to lessen the dependence on a single training set, we integrated multiple datasets. We used six training gene expression sets on the basis of the histologic grade and the estrogen receptor status, in order to derive the subnetwork based gene signatures, and used two testing gene expression sets for evaluating the performance of gene signatures. We propose a statistical model to determine the reliability weights, which are then incorporated with the gene expressions to form reliable gene expressions. The reliable gene expressions then extracts the subnetworks (isolated networks) and the associated hub-genes (a gene that has a maximum number of interactions in a subnetwork) for the gene signature construction that can be used for the ER+/ER� breast cancer classification paradigm. We call our algorithm robust reliability based hub gene expression (RRHGE) algorithm. The evaluation of our approach and the experimental comparisons with other existing approaches demonstrated that RRHGE significantly increased the classification performance. Further, in addition to the statistical evaluations, thorough biological evaluations were also conducted to show the effectiveness and stability of the proposed algorithm. This paper is organized as follows. The training and testing sets used in this study are defined in Section 2. The proposed RRHGE algorithm is defined in Section 3. Statistical validation with patient classification results and biological validation are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5. 2. Materials We downloaded six PPI datasets (BIOGRID, INTACT, MINT, DIP, BIND, and HPRD) and five breast cancer microarray gene expression datasets (GSE7390, GSE6532, GSE21653, GSE11121, and van de Vijver) and mapped the proteins to the genes in the microarray gene expression dataset to construct the gene interaction network. We integrated four of the microarray gene expression datasets, namely, GSE7390, GSE6532, GSE21653, and GSE11121, to increase the dataset size, while the fifth microarray dataset, namely, van de Vijver, was used as independent testing dataset. Six training sets were then generated from the integrated dataset for the extraction of the subnetwork based gene signatures, which is a set of genes that show stability not only on a specific dataset but also across multiple datasets that have distinct platforms. Two testing sets (the Desmedt (GSE7390) [20] and van de Vijver [11]) were also used for evaluating the algorithm's performance. The details are presented in the following subsections. 2.1. Breast Cancer Gene Expression Datasets We used five publicly available breast cancer microarray gene expression datasets by considering the factors in the dataset, that is, estrogen-receptor status (ER+ and ER?), histologic grade (Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3), overall survival (OS), and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS). In our study, 703 ER+ samples and 255 ER? samples were used for experimental analysis (selected on the basis of availability of above criterion), with a total of 958 samples. The detailed information regarding the size of the samples is shown in Table 1. The microarray gene expression datasets for breast cancer were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [24] on April 1, 2012; then, gene expression values of each dataset were normalised (or rescaled) using the formula: (1)g^ni=gni?gmin(i)gmax(i)?gmin(i), where gni defines the gene expression value of the ith feature in the sample n, gmin(i) and gmax(i) define the minimum and maximum gene expression values for the ith feature in a dataset, respectively. This normalization mapped the gene expression values generated from different protocols into a uniform framework, so that the impact of the different protocols on the data integration can be reduced. Compared with the original data, the normalized gene expressions did not show any significant differences among study objects. The datasets were converted from probe expression to gene expression, as described by Reyal et al. [25]. The probes that begin with �AFFX� are then deleted because there are no associated genes for these probes. 2.2. Transformation of PPI Datasets Protein interactions play important roles in a number of biological processes where the physiological interactions of several proteins are indulged in the construction of biological pathways, such as signal transduction pathways or metabolic pathways. We incorporated six PPI datasets into our study, namely, Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BIOGRID) [26], INTACT [27], the Molecular Interaction Database (MINT) [28], Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) [16], the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) [29], and Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) [17]. The genes in the microarray dataset were then used to construct the gene interaction network from these PPI datasets using the Universal Protein Resource Database [30]. The self-interactions and the duplicate edges within the constructed gene interaction network were removed, as they did not have any significant meaning in terms of interaction with other genes. The resulting gene interaction network from the above mentioned six PPI datasets contains 13,012 unique genes with 69,914 unique interactions among them. All the protein interaction datasets were downloaded on April 19, 2013. The PPI datasets contain a large number of protein interactions and are considered a rich information source from which biological knowledge and facts can be discovered, such as classifying ER+/ER? breast cancer subclasses or classifying patients according to their treatment outcome. However, the analyses of high-throughput protein interaction data signifies that protein interactions identified by experiments usually contain false-positive interactions (the interactions takes place in the experimental dataset but never happen in real biological processes or cells). It is believed that nearly 30�50% of interactions identified by experiments were biologically relevant, with few overlaps among protein interaction datasets from various resources [18]. As a consequence, discovered biological knowledge or inferred facts from the protein interaction database may be biased. Therefore, the identification and extraction of reliable protein interactions from the original published protein interaction datasets are considered an important yet challenging issue. With this attention, the quality of the protein interaction datasets can significantly improve and as a result strengthen the confidence of the discovered biological knowledge and facts. Since gene interaction networks are constructed from PPI networks, we combine three distinct reliability metrics to form a weighted reliability metric (?) to measure the reliability of gene interactions. In this paper, the details are presented in Section 3.1. 2.3. Training and Testing Sets To resolve the �curse of dimensionality issue,� we used five breast cancer gene expression datasets across four unique platforms in order to increase the sample size and also to balance the other factors, as mentioned in Table 1. The integrated dataset was constructed by merging four microarray datasets, namely, GSE7390, GSE6532, GSE21653, and GSE11121, which contained 958 samples. Six training sets were then constructed from the integrated dataset by initially dividing the integrated dataset on the basis of estrogen receptor status, that is, ER+ and ER?. Then, we divided the ER+ and ER? set on the basis of histologic grade, that is, Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, which led to three training sets for each estrogen receptor status, thereby, generating six training sets that were used for deriving the estrogen-receptor based gene signatures. Sotiriou et al. [8] observed that breast cancer datasets based on histologic grades had distinct gene expression profiles. In our study, the generation of six training sets on the basis of estrogen receptor status and the histologic grade reduced the bias in the datasets and increased the correlation of gene expressions within them. The six training sets used in our algorithm constructed effective gene signatures for two estrogen-receptor subtypes of breast cancer, as presented in Section 3. The subnetwork based gene signatures generated from the training sets were then tested on two testing sets (the Desmedt dataset and the van de Vijver dataset). The results are presented in Section 4. 3. Algorithm Our main focus was to extract the gene subnetworks that showed highly correlated gene expressions with the estrogen receptor status. For this the reliable gene expression metric was established to target real gene interactions that occur in biological processes and which are related to ER+/ER? breast cancers. By using the generated reliable gene expressions, the subnetwork based gene signatures that were extracted can classify ER+/ER? breast cancer patients. All the statistical validation was performed using R Statistical Toolbox [31]. Details of our algorithm are presented in the following subsections. 3.1. Reliability Metrics For an interaction between any two genes, we combined three reliability measures to assess reliability in terms of three distinct factors, that is, data sources (e.g., HPRD), experimental methods (e.g., two hybrids), and level-based interaction partners (e.g., level-2 interaction partners of a gene). The corresponding reliability measures are named R1, R2, and R3 (data sources, experimental methods and interaction partners, resp.). These reliability measures are defined below. 3.1.1. Data Source-Based Reliability (R1) Our first reliability measure is concerned with data sources that contain protein-protein interactions and from which protein interactions are mapped to the interaction of genes. In our study, we considered data sources, such as those defined in Section 2.2. The basic aim of R1 is to evaluate the weight of gene interactions across data sources. For an interaction y between any two genes (a, b), R1 is calculated by counting the number of data sources that contain y; that is, (2)R1(y)=?n=1SDn(y), where (3)??Dn(y)={1,if??data??source??n??contains??interaction??y,0,otherwise. Here, S defines the number of data sources. The rationale for this definition is the more data sources the interaction is regenerated in, the reliable it is. Therefore, the higher the R1 IS, the more reliable the gene interaction is. 3.1.2. Experimental Method-Based Reliability (R2) The second reliability measure evaluates the reliability of an interaction on the basis of the experimental methods. The basic idea is the same as R1; however, this time we consider how many experimental methods (e.g., affinity-chromatography, in vivo, in vitro) identified a particular interaction. Therefore, R2 is defined as the reliability measure which evaluates the reliability of any interaction y between (a, b) by counting the number of experimental methods that identified y; that is, (4)??R2(y)=?n=1NEn(y), where (5)??En(y)={1,if??experimental??method??n??identified??interaction??y,0,otherwise. Here, N defines the number of experimental methods. The higher the R2 of an interaction is, the more reliable the gene interaction is. 3.1.3. Interaction Level-Based Reliability (R3) The third reliability measure evaluates the reliability by considering the gene partners of two directly interacting genes. In a gene interaction network, if any two interacting genes have a higher number of level-2 neighbours (if any gene a is interacting with gene b, then b is level-1 neighbour of a, and the interaction partners of b are level-2 neighbours of a), they are considered more reliable among those with a lower number of level-2 neighbours [32, 33]. The principle behind this reliability measure is that the interacting gene pairs that interact with the genes, but which have no further interactions, are more likely to be an unreliable or false-positive interaction. However, if they have further interactions, they are seen as reliable interactions because the biological processes performed their functions in the group of interactions that is more complex compared to others. Therefore, R3 is defined as the reliability measure that evaluates the reliability of any interaction y between (a, b) by counting the number of their level-2 neighbours; that is, (6)????????R3(y)=?n=1M[Ina+??Inb], where (7)??Ina={1,if??gene??n??is??level-2??neighbour??of??gene??a,0,otherwise.?? Here, M defines the total number of genes in the interaction network. For any interaction y, R3 is can be evaluated, where the higher the value of R3, the more reliable the gene interaction is and vice-versa. 3.1.4. Weighted Reliability Measure After evaluating the reliability measure based on data sources (R1), experimental methods (R2), and level-based interaction partners (R3), we performed two major steps. First, each of the reliability measures was normalised (by using the formula similar to (1)) across gene interactions, where the normalized reliabilities are within the range [0, 1]. The essentiality of normalisation is to propose a global scale of reliability that defines the reliability strength of each reliability measure within that scale. For simplicity, we still denote the normalised reliabilities as R1, R2, and R3, which were then used to construct multivariate linear regression model to form the weighted reliability measure (?) defined as (8)???(y)=?0+?n=13?n??Rn(y), where ?(y) defines the weighted reliability measure for yth interaction, ?0 defines the constant, and ?n defines the regression coefficient for the nth reliability measure (i.e., Rn(y) variable). Here, Rn(y) is a promoting factor if ?n > 0, and Rn(y) is a supressing factor if ?n < 0. A complete model with a P value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 3.2. Gene Expression Metrics For each of the k training sets, the gene expression values of each gene are summarized by calculating the generalized mean of gene expressions (G) across the samples, which is defined as (9)G(a)=1n?i=1n[gia]2, where n is the total number of samples, and gia defines the gene expression value of gene a in the ith sample. Next, each gene in our gene interaction network is assigned a summarized value from each training set using (9), thus leading to a total of k gene interaction networks (from k training sets). Finally, in each gene interaction network, each interaction y between (a, b) is then assigned a merged gene expression (?) value from their interacting genes, which is defined as (10)?(y)=2?G(a)?G(b)G(a)+G(b)."
Breast_Cancer "Since the gene interactions are not reliable and contain many false-positive interactions that do not take place in real biological processes (see Section 2.2), therefore, we need to combine the ? values and the reliability measure ? to accurately identify the reliable subnetwork based on differentially expressed genes. 3.3. Reliable Gene Expression Metrics To construct the gene network that signifies the reliability of each gene interaction with their associated gene expressions, we incorporated the proposed reliability measure (?) with the merged gene expression value (?) of gene interactions and called it reliable gene expression (?). As the ? measure assesses the reliability of each gene interaction on the basis of three vital criteria, the ? measure assesses the integrated gene expression of each gene interaction. However, before defining the ? metric, we need to define the correlation between ? and ? to evaluate whether or not the ? and ? of any interaction y between (a, b) are positively correlated. We evaluate the correlation coefficient (?) as (11)?(y)=(?(y)???)(?(y)???)(?(y)???)2(?(y)???)2, where ?- and ?- represent the ? and ? mean of all the interactions in a training set, respectively. With this measure (11), the relationship between ? and ? can be evaluated, that is, whether it is positively correlated (?(y) = 1), negatively correlated (?(y) = ? 1), or not correlated at all (?(y) = 0). We are interested in extracting the positively correlated terms as they are more strongly related to patterns that can construct gene signatures that qualitatively classify the ER+/ER? subtypes of breast cancer. In other words, for a gene interaction y, if the relationship strength of their ? and ? shows ?(y) = 1, then a gene interaction has more chances of being biologically true and related to the phenotype. Once the positively correlated interactions are extracted for each of the six training sets, the ? can then be evaluated. The ? of any interaction y can be evaluated by performing multivariate linear regression analysis of ? and ?, which is represented as (12)?(y)=?0+?1(?(y))+?2(?(y)), where, ?1 and ?2 represents the regression coefficients for ?(y) and ?(y), respectively. Once evaluated, the significant gene interactions (with P value <0.05) are extracted for each training set. These are then used to construct the gene signatures to classify the samples based on the ER+/ER? status. Details are presented in the following subsections. 3.4. Robust Reliability Based Hub Gene Expression Algorithm (RRHGE) Significant positively correlated reliable gene interactions are used to construct the discriminative subnetworks for each training set by using the Cytoscape [34]. The ? values of the interactions in the discriminative subnetworks are then taken for the hub-gene evaluation, where the hub-gene is the gene in the subnetwork that contains maximal interactions amongst other genes. For each training set, it may be possible that several subnetworks exist, with each subnetwork used for the hub-gene evaluation. Figure 1 illustrates this concept. For each of the k training sets, once the subnetwork based hub-genes are identified, two major steps are performed. First, the subnetwork score (?) is calculated for each subnetwork in a training set by using (13); that is, (13)(?)On=?y?Yn?(y), where, On??(n = 1,2 �, N) is any subnetwork, and Yn is the set of all gene interactions in On. A subnetwork with a maximum subnetwork score (?) is chosen and retained for further analysis. A maximum ? based subnetwork is chosen because that subnetwork shows highly connected reliable gene interactions amongst other subnetworks for a given training set and is believed to indulge in essential real biological processes that relate to cancers. By using this step, only the subnetwork with the maximum ? is chosen, and other subnetworks are ignored. However, other subnetworks might contain essential genes which have the strength to be effective and stable gene signatures. Therefore, to identify those significant genes, the following operations are performed, which use hub-gene topology. For each training set, hub-genes with their interactors for each subnetwork are identified (as shown in Figure 1). Then, the hub-gene score (?) is evaluated as (14)(?)sn=1|Hn|?h?Hn?(h), where h is an interaction between any gene with the hub-gene, and |Hn| stands for the number of gene interactions that occur for the hub-gene in On. In other words, for a given subnetwork, the hub-score is the average ? of the genes that interact with the hub-gene. In this way, the hub-score for each subnetwork in a training set can be evaluated. The associated hub-gene score (?) of the chosen subnetwork with the maximum subnetwork score (?) is then used as a threshold for extracting significant gene interactions. This can be done by comparing the ? value of a chosen subnetwork with all of the other ? from other subnetworks in a given training set. If any of the other subnetworks have ? greater than the ? of the chosen subnetwork, their hub-gene with their interactors is chosen. The reason for selecting the hub-gene as the benchmark is that a hub-gene has the maximum number of interactions in a given subnetwork, with high probability these interactions will act as driver genes for cancers that indulge in several essential biological functions and processes [35]. Chang et al. [36] discovered that hub-genes are significantly related to metastasis-related genes. Also, Jonsson and Bates [37] showed that cancer-associated genes, which are translated from human proteins, show an increase in the number of interactors they interact with and also show them working as the central hubs. Therefore, hub-gene topology is used to extract the significant genes from the subnetworks (other than the chosen subnetwork) of a given training set. Finally, for each training set, the subnetwork list, that is, a subnetwork chosen from (13) and the hub-genes with their interactors chosen from (14), is retained to extract the gene signature to classify ER+ and ER? breast cancer subtypes. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of these steps. 3.5. Classification Process and Performance Assessment First, the common genes are extracted from the subnetwork lists of ER+ training sets. Operations are similar for the ER? training sets. After that, duplicates were removed between the common genes of ER+ and ER? subnetwork lists. Finally, the RRHGE gene signature was constructed that consists of ER+ subnetwork lists, called ER+ gene signature (for ER+ subtype) and ER? subnetwork lists, called ER? gene signature (for ER? subtype). The RRHGE gene signature, which consists of ER+ and ER? gene signatures, is then used to classify ER+/ER? samples in the testing sets by transforming each sample j into ER+ score (S+) and ER? score (S?) using (15)S+(j)=?g?Xe(g,j)|X|,S?(j)=?k?Ye(k,j)|Y|, where X = {genes of the ER+ gene signature}, Y = {genes of the ER? gene signature}, |�| stands for the number of set elements, and e(g, j) is the expression of gene g in sample j. With these two scores each sample j can be mapped as a point in a two-dimensional feature space ?2, then, the classification was done by three-nearest neighbour (3NN) classifier with L1 distance [38]. Since, microarray datasets usually contain unequal ratio between number of ER+ and ER? samples; therefore accuracy is not a good criteria to measure classification performance of an algorithm in the testing datasets. Rather, we used a classification performance measure, called matthews coefficient correlation (MCC) for comparison of different algorithms [39]. If TP represents the number of true positives, TN represents the number of true negatives, FP represents the number of false positives, and FN represents the number of false negatives, then the MCC can be evaluated as (16)MCC=(TP�TN)?(FP�FN)(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN). In the above equation, if any of the four sums is 0 then the denominator is set to 1, since this results in an MCC equal to zero. In general, MCC value of 1 reflects perfect prediction, ?1 reflects false prediction, and 0 reflects random prediction. MCC is a recommended measure for evaluating classification performance in comparison with other measures [38, 40]. 4. Results As indicated in Section 2.2, our gene interaction network contained 13,012 unique genes with 69,914 unique interactions between them, generated from six data sources. For evaluating the reliability of the gene interaction network, the weighted reliability measure (?) was constructed (see (8)). The �stats� package of the R-project [31] has been used to evaluate the regression coefficients of ?; that is, (17)?(y)=0.7138(R1(y))+0.2912(R2(y))+0.3072(R3(y)). Here, ?0 is very small, that is, ?4.83E ? 15, and so we assigned ?0 as zero."
Breast_Cancer "The complete model was significant (P value <0.001). With this measure (17), the higher the ?(y) value is, the higher the reliability of the interaction is. Next, the integrated microarray dataset of 1,253 samples was constructed (see Table 1). The samples with repetitions or a missing histologic grade and estrogen receptor status based information were excluded. 958 samples remained, consisting of 703 ER+ samples and 255 ER? samples. Six training sets were then constructed from the integrated dataset, that is, three for ER+ and three for ER? (i.e., Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, resp.), which generated six gene interaction networks with their merged gene expression (?) value (see Section 3.2 for details). Further, the ? and ? were incorporated to construct reliable gene expression (?) (see (12)) for each of the six training sets, by using multivariate linear regression model with their regression coefficients as shown in Table 3. Therefore, by applying RRHGE algorithm, the final gene signature set consists of 471 genes, that is, 326 distinct genes for the ER+ subtype (called ER+ gene signature) and 145 for the ER? subtype (called ER? gene signature) (see Table 2), which can classify the samples as either ER+ or ER?, as defined in Section 3.5. The complete algorithm workflow is shown in Figure 2. The Supplementary Table S1 (shown in Supplementary Material available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/362141) lists the genes in our RRHGE gene signature. The classification results on the two testing datasets, in addition to a comparison with previously established algorithms, are detailed in the following subsections. 4.1. Classification Performance To test the classification performance of the gene signatures, we applied them on two testing sets, that is, Desmedt and van de Vijver datasets. We compared the RRHGE algorithm based on gene signature with RRHGE-H (i.e., gene signatures extracted from the six training sets by considering only hub-genes), RRHGE-HI (i.e., by considering only hub-genes with their interactions in each of the six training sets), RRHGE-TSN (i.e., by considering only top subnetwork in each of the six training sets), and also with five other previously existing algorithms, these are: the 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) [11], the 76-gene signature [12], the Genomic Grade Index (GGI) [8], the Interactome-Transcriptome Integration (ITI) [7], and the Hub-based Reliable Gene Expression (HRGE) [19]. Table 4 shows the detailed classification results of RRHGE, along with RRHGE-H, RRHGE-HI, RRHGE-TSN, and other existing algorithms, and Figure 3 shows the MCC comparison of algorithms in Desmedt and van de Vijver datasets, respectively. The results show that the RRHGE approach was able to achieve better results and was superior if considering only hub-genes in each of the six subnetworks, if considering hub-genes along with interactions in each of the six subnetworks, or if considering only top-subnetwork in each of the six subnetworks. Also, RRHGE is superior to other existing algorithms. Specifically, the results show that our RRHGE approach achieved MCC of 0.87 and 0.70 in the testing sets of Desmedt and van de Vijver, respectively. On the Desmedt dataset, RRHGE gave better MCC as compared to RRHGE-H which gave 0.53, RRHGE-HI which gave 0.54, RRHGE-TSN which gave 0.80, HRGE which gave 0.51, ITI which gave 0.27, GGI which gave 0.12, 76?g which gave ?0.02, and 70?g which gave ?0.14. Amongst the existing algorithms, HRGE showed the second best MCC after RRHGE on Desmedt dataset. Similar results can be observed from the van de Vijver dataset, which demonstrated the RRHGE is still superior to other algorithms based on MCC. However, on the van de Vijver dataset, 76?g showed the second best MCC after RRHGE. This suggests that the classification performance of other existing gene signatures is heavily dependent on datasets and other factors, such as microarray platforms. We believe the dependency on datasets can be reduced and the classification performance can be strengthened by increasing the training compendia and incorporating multiple platforms across multiple datasets. In the testing sets of Desmedt and van de Vijver, the HRGE, ITI, GGI, 70?g, and 76?g MCC patterns varied significantly. In other words, these algorithms were not stable enough to obtain similar classification results in distinct datasets, which indicates that these algorithms were biased towards the dataset used for classification analysis. However, the RRHGE subnetwork based algorithm showed stable classification performance in both testing datasets by achieving the highest MCC amongst other representative algorithms. We also noticed that the RRHGE-TSN shows little lower classification performance compared with RRHGE (see Table 4). Therefore, if the computational costs is a concern, then RRHGE-TSN can serve the optimal classifier, since it requires only the top subnetwork. However, if classification performance is of the prime concern, which is the initial aim of our study, then RRHGE serves as the best classifier. Since ER+ subtype generally shows higher survival rate of patients compared to ER?, so we called it a good prognosis group. However, ER? subtype shows lesser survival rate and is also more aggressive compared to ER+, so we called it a poor prognosis group [41, 42]. Now, in order to determine if the RRHGE gene signature is able to separate the ER+ (good prognosis) patients group and ER? (poor prognosis) patients group using the distant metastasis free survival rate (DMFS) and overall survival rate (OS) information in the microarray dataset, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The �survival� package of the R-project [31] has been used to perform the survival analysis between the ER+ and ER? patient groups for the Desmedt dataset, which generated the DMFS and OS survival curves of RRHGE, as shown in Figure 4. We first performed the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for distant metastasis free survival ER+ and ER? patient groups. The log-rank statistical test gave P value of 3.15E ? 08, which was statistically significant (i.e., P < 0.001) and showed good separation between the two patient groups (Figure 4(a)). Similarly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of overall survival for ER+ and ER? patient groups showed a P value of 1.47E ? 05, suggesting good separation between the two patient groups (Figure 4(b)). These results validate that the RRHGE gene signature is effective in separating patients into two prognosis groups on the basis of the DMFS rate and the OS rate, which can determine the patient's expectancy level for the event (distant metastasis or death). Therefore, we can identify the patients group that may require more or less aggressive treatment strategy. To illustrate the behavioural pattern of ER+ and ER? gene signatures of RRHGE on the Desmedt dataset, heatmaps are drawn that show the differential expressions of genes in ER+ samples and ER? samples. Although the genes in a gene signature group seem correlated with two estrogen-receptor based subtypes, no single gene shows uniformity of expressions across samples (see Supplementary Figure S1). This illustrates the significance of the gene signatures as a multigene classification method. Using the heatmaps, distinct gene expression patterns can be visualised for the ER+ and ER? breast cancer samples. From Supplementary Figure S1, it is true to say the RRHGE gene signature is highly instructive in distinguishing the behavioural patterns of ER+ and ER? breast cancer subtypes. 4.2. Signature Stability with Existing Gene Signatures As indicated by Garcia et al. [7], the gene signatures of van de Vijver and Wang show three mutual genes among them, which comprise less than 5% of all the genes in their signatures. We performed the gene signature stability analysis of RRHGE with other existing algorithms based gene signatures, as mentioned in Section 4.1. When compared with the ITI gene signature, 175 genes were found in common, corresponding to nearly 37% of genes. Compared with the 70 gene signature, only 3 genes were found in common and with the 76 gene signature, only 2 genes were found in common. In addition, the 186-gene �invasiveness� gene signature (IGS) [43] was compared with the RRHGE gene signature, and 10 genes were found in common. These comparison results are shown in Table 5. These small overlaps of genes signified that datasets were biased, and possibly the genes in the gene signature were not biologically relevant due to the algorithm's limitations. We discovered that these gene signatures extracted from the subnetworks were able to achieve better results than the gene signatures extracted from the gene lists, that is, non-subnetwork based gene signatures. As ITI is a subnetwork based approach, we found that more than 35% of these genes were in common with RRHGE. This is significantly greater than the gene lists based gene signatures. This signifies that subnetwork based gene signatures are able to achieve higher classification performance (Table 4) and also shows higher numbers of overlapped genes amongst other gene list based gene signatures (Table 5). However, the overlap amongst subnetwork based gene signatures can be largely increased by incorporating significantly larger numbers of training sets with multiple platform types. Table 5 shows the number of genes in the RRHGE gene signature that overlapped with other gene signatures. 4.3. Biological Analysis of RRHGE Gene Signature To identify the significant enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways associated with the ER+ and ER? breast cancer subtypes, the enriched biological process gene ontology terms [4] and the KEGG pathways [5] were computed for each gene in our gene signature using DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) [44]. For each gene, the DAVID output the enriched biological process GO terms and the pathways associated with it by providing the P values that were computed with hyper geometric distribution. Therefore, for all genes in the gene signature, their enriched GO terms and pathways can be calculated with their P values in order to biologically validate the results. First, we performed GO analysis. The Supplementary Table S2 shows the enriched GO terms for the RRHGE gene signature. From Table S2, it can be seen that the biological process GO terms of our subnetwork based gene signatures were correlated with the processes that were seen to be disrupted in cancers such as apoptosis, cell death, DNA damage response, insulin stimulus response, cell proliferation, nuclear mRNA splicing via spliceosome, cell cycle regulation, and many others. This demonstrates that the biological meaning of the gene signature is significant and highly associated with the cancers. The genes associated with these significant enriched GO terms are also shown in Supplementary Table S2. Next, we performed pathway analysis. The Supplementary Table S3 shows the enriched pathways for the RRHGE gene signature. From Table S3, it can be seen that the pathways associated with the genes in the RRHGE gene signature were correlated with cancers, such as ATM signaling pathway, p53 signaling, focal adhesion class pathway, cellular aging and immortality, and many others. The genes associated with these significant enriched pathways are also shown in Supplementary Table S3. Many of the genes in the RRHGE gene signature are already defined as well-known oncogenes, such as AR, BRCA1, CDK2, and CCND1, besides others, whose differential expression has been associated with the subtypes of breast cancer. For other genes not previously reported as oncogenes, these could be newly discovered genes that may act as breast cancer driver genes and may promote cancer aggressiveness by distant metastasis. 5. Discussions and Conclusions In this study, we proposed a reliable gene expression metrics (?) to measure and extract the reliable gene interactions from gene interaction networks in terms of real biological processes and incorporated the extracted reliable gene interactions into our proposed algorithm: robust reliability based hub gene expression algorithm (RRHGE). The RRHGE algorithm uses hub-gene topology to identify significant genes for classifying ER+ and ER? breast cancer samples effectively. The resultant RRHGE gene signature consists of 471 genes, that is, 326 genes for ER+ and 145 genes for ER? subtype. From this study, we observed that the subnetwork based gene signatures are more reproducible across the datasets and are able to provide higher classification performance amongst the non-subnetwork based gene signatures. The subnetwork based gene signature of RRHGE was statistically validated on the basis of MCC performance measure by comparing RRHGE-H, RRHGE-HI, RRHGE-TSN, and four other existing algorithms. "
Breast_Cancer "The classification results (Table 4) demonstrated that our RRHGE based gene signature was able to accurately characterize a high number of ER+ and ER? samples in the testing sets. In other words, our gene signature was highly effective in characterizing the ER+/ER? breast cancer subtypes without depending on any specific dataset or on any other factors. The gene signature of our RRHGE algorithm was also validated biologically using GO and pathway analysis, and the results demonstrated that the significant enriched GO terms and pathways of the genes in our gene signature were associated with the processes shown to be disrupted in cancers. We observed that if gene interactions in the network are reliable, then classification performance will significantly increase, compared with cases where the reliability criterion is not considered. As a matter of fact, this provides us with a possible research direction to improve the reliability metrics by incorporating highly biologically related information. In addition, it is worthwhile investigating how the classification performance behaves if we integrate other data types, such as the DNA copy number variation. Supplementary Material The Supplementary Material consists of four files, including Tables S1, S2, and S3 and Figure S1. Table S1 shows the list of the genes in the gene signature constructed by the RRHGE algorithm.

Background Breast cancer with oestrogen receptor expression is common in older women. Several factors, such as age and reproductive hormone exposure, have been associated with oestrogen receptor expression in breast cancer. However, the association between comorbidities and the oestrogen receptor expression has been poorly studied. We hypothesized that there was an association between burden comorbidity and breast cancer with oestrogen receptor expression in older women. Objective To determine whether oestrogen receptor expression in breast cancer was associated with burden comorbidity in community-dwelling women. Methods A total of 1,707 women with breast cancer registered on the list of a breast cancer registry were included. The recorded data included: age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score?1, breast cancer characteristics (coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology), and breast cancer pathological stage (the pathological-tumour-node-metastasis, Scarff Bloom Richardson, and hormonal status of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor). Results Breast cancer with oestrogen receptor expression was identified in 1,378 patients (80�7%). The fully-adjusted logistic regression showed that oestrogen receptor expression was associated with Charlson Comorbidity Index score?1 (odds ratio [OR]?=?1�91,95%confidence interval [CI]?=?[1.01�3.61], P?=?0�048), progesterone receptor expression (OR?=?16�64, 95%CI?=?[11.62�23.81], P<0�001), human epidermal growth factor receptor (OR?=?0�54, 95%CI?=?[0.34�0.84], P?=?0�007), age (OR?=?1.02, 95%CI?=?[1.00�1.03], P?=?0.008), Scarff Bloom Richardson grade II and grade III (OR?=?0�21with 95%CI?=?[0.10�0.44] and OR?=?0�06 with 95%CI?=?[0.03�0.12], P<0�001). Conclusion Our findings provide new data showing an independent positive association between burden comorbidity and breast cancer with oestrogen receptor expression. This result confirms that evaluation of oestrogen receptor expression in breast cancer should not be limited to hormonal factors stratified by age.

Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States (US) and Europe [1]. The incidence rate for BC increases with age, explaining that 60% of diagnosis of BC occurred after 65 years and older [2]. Clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of BC are heterogeneous, thus BC has been classified into different subtypes [3]. One of these subtypes refers to immunohistochemical expression of hormonal receptors including oestrogens, progesterone, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) [4]. Hormonal receptor identification is important for the management of BC. For instance, BC with oestrogen receptor (ER) expression (ER+) may be treated with specific endocrine therapy and it has a better prognosis than BC without ER [5]. Thus, understanding which factors influence the expression of ER could be helpful for improving BC management. Several factors, such as age and exposure to reproductive hormones, have been associated with ER+ in BC [3]. Compared to these factors, few studies have examined the association with comorbidities; that is, one or more other chronic or acute diseases in an individual with an index-disease (BC in our study) [4], [6]. Similar to the expression of ER and age that influence BC prognosis [6], comorbidities affect cancer mortality [7], [8]. For instance, comorbidities clearly impact the risk of death [9], [10], [11] and the risk of cancer recurrence [12]. Because of the age-related increase in BC with ER+ and chronic diseases [13], [14] it could be assumed that there is an association between comorbidity burden and ER+ in BC in older women. Only a few studies have examined the association between comorbidities and BC with ER+. These studies reported mixed results [4], [15], [16]. Some studies failed to find an association [15], [16], whereas others reported significant associations [4], [16]. One explanation of the apparent discrepancy may be related to the definition and quantification of comorbidities in the same individual. Different tools have been specifically developed to score the comorbidities burden, or the number of chronic diseases and their severity [17]. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a standardized and validated method for scoring comorbidities and predicting mortality by weighting chronic conditions [18]. We hypothesized that there was an association between the comorbidities burden quantified using the CCI score and ER+ in BC in older women. The aim of this study was to determine whether BC with ER+ was associated with the CCI score in community-dwelling women. Materials and Methods Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards set forth in the Helsinki Declaration (1983). The Angers Ethical Committee approved the study protocol and the study is in compliance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement guidelines. The institutional review board waived the need for written informed consent from the participants. Waiving of consent was authorized for this study according to French law. Participants A total of 1,855 women with BC were included in this cross-sectional study. All participants were registered on three cancer registries involving the following French administrative areas: Doubs, Loire-Atlantique, and Tarn. The inclusion criterion for the study was BC diagnosis in 2007. The exclusion criterion was male gender. Information collected by the BC registry came from several databases involving public and private pathology laboratories and hospitals, the regional French National Health System, and Comprehensive Cancer Centres. Because analyses in the present study focused on ER status, we excluded 148 women (8.0%) who had unknown ER status. Therefore, full data were available for 1,707 (92�0%) women in the registry. Clinical Assessment Data collected by the cancer registries and used in this study were age, comorbidities (the number of chronic diseases and their severity), and the BC characteristics coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition. In addition, the BC pathological-tumour-node-metastasis (PTNM) was assessed using the recommendations of the 5th edition of Union for International Cancer Control. The stages have been grouped into three groups: the first group combined stage 0 and I tumours less than 2 cm without lymph node involvement, the second group combined stage II and III tumours comprising between 2�1 cm and 5 cm, with or without lymphadenopathy, and the third group corresponded to stage IV metastatic tumours. Furthermore, the Scarff Bloom Richardson (SBR) grade, modified by Elston and Ellis, was also measured because this classification of BC evaluates the �aggressiveness� of the tumour by taking into account the speed of tumour development and its management [12]. The hormonal status of ER, PR, and the HER was also recorded. Comorbidities were scored using CCI. The CCI was validated in 1987 by ME Charlson [18] and consists of 18 groups of diseases with a weighted number assigned to each disease category [1]�[3], [13]. The weighted numbers are summed to obtain an overall score. Because a CCI score ?1 defined comorbid condition [13], [18], this value was set as the cut-off point to separate women into the two groups for this analysis. Statistics The participants' baseline characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. Normality of the data distribution was evaluated using the Skewness-Kurtosis test. As the number of observations was >40 for each group, no transformations were applied to the variables of interest. Participants were separated into two groups based on the presence or absence of ER. Between-group comparisons were performed using an independent sample t-test or chi-square (?2) test, as appropriate. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between the presence of ER (dependent variable) and the CCI score?1 (independent variable) adjusted for the participants' baseline characteristics. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistics were performed using SPSS (version 15�0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Results As shown in Table 1, a total of 1,378 (80�7%) patients had BC with ER+. These women were older (P<0�001) than those without ER expression. PTNM stages 0-I (P?=?0�045) and IV (P?=?0�014) were more prevalent only among participants with ER+ tumours. In addition, the expression of ER was associated with the presence of PR (P<0�001). The expression of HER and SBR grade were lower (P<0�001) in women with BC with ER+ compared to those without. There were no significant differences between the groups for the other characteristics. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098127.t001 Table 1 Comparison of baseline characteristics among breast cancer cases and oestrogen receptor status (n?=?1,707).

This association was independent of age, other hormonal receptors, PTNM stages, and SBR grades. Furthermore, the grade of tumors and the presence of HER were significantly associated with ER-, whereas the expression of PR and age were related to ER+. Finally, our findings indicate that PTNM stages were not associated with ER expression. The comorbidity burden quantified by the CCI score was an independent factor associated with the expression of ER in the sample of studied women. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the association between the comorbidity burden and ER+ in BC. It has been reported that the comorbidity burden is associated with increased mortality and affects prognosis and treatment in all hormonal types of BC [19], [20], [21]. Most previous contradictory studies likely focused on specific cormorbidities such as the metabolic syndrome (defined as an association of high blood pressure, obesity, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes) or obesity alone for two main reasons [4], [15], [16]. Firstly, obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with hormonal status, and in particular, with the presence of oestrogen, which is a reproductive hormone that has a determinant role in BC aetiology [3]. Secondly, cardiovascular comorbidities (including metabolic syndrome and obesity) are the most prevalent diseases in women with BC [22]. Unlike these previous studies, we chose to examine the association with the CCI score because it integrates the number and the severity of chronic disease, and because it is associated with the risk of death [7]. The CCI score is a better marker of an individual's morbidity status because it reflects the global comorbidities burden, rather than a single aspect of the adverse effect of one comorbidity. Thus, we suggest that the CCI score, which includes the effects of all comorbidities and not only those of hormonal comorbidities, appears to be a consistent measure of the association between comorbidities and ER+ in BC. The pathophysiological support of the association between comorbidities and ER+ reported in our study is not yet fully elucidated. It could be related to the fact that ER belongs to the super-family of the nuclear hormone receptors involved both in cancers and other morbidities [23]. For instance, the ER+ has been shown in comorbidities such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, or cardiovascular diseases and breast and endometrial cancers [23]. Furthermore, it has been reported that there is a polymorphism in steroid hormone genes in the most frequent morbidities including cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and cancers [24]. Aromatase gene polymorphisms have also been related to comorbidities such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, or cardiovascular diseases and several cancers [24]. Age was significantly associated with ER+ in our study. This association may be considered as clinically relevant. Indeed, the OR was calculated at 1.02, which corresponds to an increase of 2% per year of the association between age and ER+ for a woman of 60.8 years old. Considering periods of 10 years, it means that 20% of women aged 71 years old, or 40% of women aged 81 years old with BC have ER+. This result is in concordance with previous studies in which the number of BC with ER expression increased with age [5], [10], [13], [14]. However, compared to the present study, comorbidities were not used as an independent variable in these previous studies. Aging is a heterogeneous continuous process [25] characterized by the accumulation of comorbidities, explaining a strong relationship between these two variables. We examined this relationship in our population and found, as previously reported, that the CCI score increased significantly with age (data not shown) [6], [8]. However, our results underscored that, despite the close relationship between age and comorbidity, there was a specific and independent association of comorbidity burden with ER+. Regarding the other hormonal status in our study, BC with PR expression was positively associated with ER+. This result is in concordance with previous studies [5], [26]. This positive association is the most frequent phenotype and is related to a higher concentration of endogenous steroids [27], [28]. In our study, the absence of HER expression and histological lower grading of BC also positively associated with ER+, which is in agreement with previous published data [29], [30], [31] and confirms that the population studied is a representative population of BC patients. Some limitations of the study should to be considered. First, the cross-sectional design of the present study may limit exploring the association between BC with ER+ and comorbidities compared to a prospective cohort design and thus prevent causal inferences. Second, although we were able to control for several characteristics that may have modified the association, residual potential confounders might still be present. Indeed, we were not able to control for factors related to hormonal status, such as nulliparity, metabolic syndrome, age at first birth, and menarche. However, studies showed that a systemic exposure of these factors was associated with the hormonal status of BC [3]. In conclusion, our study provides new data showing an independent positive association between a CCI score?1 and BC with ER+. This result confirms that evaluation of ER expression in BC should not be limited to hormonal factors stratified by age [3]. The comorbidity burden as a determinant risk factor of hormonal status in BC should open further areas of research. "
Breast_Cancer "Background: Although Trastuzumab has improved survival of HER2+ breast cancer patients, resistance to the agent pre-exists or develops through the course of therapy. Here we show that a specific metabolism and autophagy-related cancer cell phenotype relates to resistance of HER2+ breast cancer to Trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with locally advanced primary breast cancer were prospectively scheduled to received one cycle of Trastuzumab followed by a new biopsy on day 21, followed by taxol/Trastuzumab chemotherapy for four cycles before surgery. FDG PET/CT scan was used to monitor tumour response. Tissue samples were immunohistochemically analysed for metabolism and autophagy markers. Results: In pre-Trastuzumab biopsies, the LC3A+/HER2+ cell population was correlated with HIF1? expression (P=0.01), while GLUT1 and LC3B expression were correlated with Ki67 proliferation index (P=0.01 and P=0.01, respectively). FDG PET tumour dimensions before therapy were correlated with LC3B expression (P=0.005). Administration of Trastuzumab significantly reduced clinical and PET-detected tumour dimensions (P<0.01). An inverse association of tumour response with the percentage of cells expressing HIF1? at baseline was documented (P=0.01). Administration of Trastuzumab resulted in a decrease of the proliferation index (P=0.004), GLUT1 (P=0.04) and HER2 (P=0.01) expression. In contrast, the percentage of LC3A+/HER2+ cells was increased (P=0.01). High baseline HIF1? expression was the only parameter associated with poorer pathological response to preoperative chemotherapy (P=0.001). Conclusions: As the HER2+/LC3A+ phenotype, which often overexpresses HIF1?, is a major subpopulation increasing after therapy with Trastuzumab, LC3A- and HIF1?-targeting therapies should be investigated for the augmentation of anti-HER2 therapy efficacy. breast cancer HER2 autophagy HIF1? Trastuzumab FDG PET/CT Breast cancer is the most frequent carcinoma in women with a lifetime risk affecting ?12% of the total population (Siegel et al, 2012). The biology of the disease is heterogeneous and ?20% of breast carcinomas overexpress the HER2/c-erbB-2 oncoprotein (Gajria and Chandarlapaty, 2011). This receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, has tyrosine kinase activity and is located at the breast cancer cell membrane. This dimerises with all members of the family, when they bind to various cognate ligands. This dimerisation induces autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues and initiates a signalling cascade within the cell. This includes activation of MAP-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and protein kinase-C, among others. As a result, tumours with a high percentage of HER2-positive cells assume an aggressive clinical behaviour so that overexpression is linked with poor post-operative outcome and increased resistance to chemotherapy (Gajria and Chandarlapaty, 2011). The introduction into clinical practice of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies or specific inhibitors of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity has resulted in important prolongation of overall survival, whether these are used as an adjuvant therapy, a component of chemotherapy for metastatic disease or as a component of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2 positive disease (Chang, 2010). Nevertheless, only 35% of advanced HER2 positive tumours respond to anti-HER2 therapies and 70% of responders will develop disease progression during therapy (Gajria and Chandarlapaty, 2011). Intrinsic resistance of cancer cells is certainly a major determinant of the efficacy of Trastuzumab. PTEN suppression, SRC nonmembrane tyrosine kinase overexpression and constitutive PIK3/Akt activation have been identified as components of intrinsic resistance (Nagata et al, 2004; Narayan et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2011). Steric effects like HER2 mutations that lack the extracellular domain or have internal domain mutations are another mechanism. Overexpression of other tyrosine kinase receptors, like c-met, may bypass the HER2 signalling pathway blockage (Minuti et al, 2012). Identification of targetable biological pathways involved in anti-HER2 therapy resistance would make a contribution to the prolongation of life expectancy of patients with HER2+ metastatic disease or even increase survival rates in case of patients with locoregional disease. In the current prospective clinicopathological study we assessed three aspects of response to Trastuzumab: (1) the ability of baseline features of tumour metabolism assessed with PET-CT and immunohistochemistry for GLUT1, HIF1?, cancer cell proliferation (Ki67) and autophagy hallmarks LC3A and LC3B to predict early response to Trastuzumab assessed by changes in Ki67 and PET FDG; (2) the baseline variables and their relation to pathological response to Trastuzumab and (3) the change in variables after Trastuzumab alone and their relation to pathological response to Trastuzumab and taxol. Materials and Methods Twenty-eight patients with locally advanced primary breast cancer, diagnosed using incisional biopsy, were prospectively scheduled to received 1 cycle of Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Roche, Milan, Italy) 8?mg per kg iv on day 0, before starting any other treatment. After 21 days Tru-cut biopsy was performed. Patients and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients were treated thereafter with four cycles of chemotherapy (Trastuzumab 6?mg per kg iv and paclitaxel 80?mg?m?2 per week, q21) till definitive surgery. Quadrantectomy or radical mastectomy was performed when indicated in association with full axillary node dissection. All patients were required to have at study inclusion a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ?2, a neutrophil count ?1.5 � 109 per litre, a platelet count >100 � 109 per litre, normal hepatic and renal function as determined by serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal and creatinine clearance >60?ml per minute and no acute or chronic infections or inflammatory diseases. Any chemotherapy or hormone therapy was excluded during the �biological window' opportunity treatment (3 weeks). Patients recently (<1 week) or simultaneously treated with steroids or diabetic patients were considered ineligible for the study. All patients received Trastuzumab on an outpatient basis and provided written informed consent prior to screening. The institutional review board approved this prospective study. Tumour dimensions were measured clinically and on FDG PET/CT scan before administration of Trastuzumab and on post-therapy day 21. The SUVmax was also assessed as a marker of tumour metabolic activity. The results of chemotherapy were quantified as the post-operative pathologically measured tumour dimensions. 18FDG-PET/CT The 18FDG-PET scans were carried out using a Discovery ST GE Healthcare PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA; CT eight-slice) and performed at baseline, after 21�2 days of treatment (window of opportunity based on Trastuzumab) and before definitive surgery. Two experienced PET readers analysed the 18FDG-PET/CT images independently. Standardised uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. The observers were blinded for any clinical data including the site of the primary tumour. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. During the study, clinicians and pathologists were blinded to the 18FDG-PET/TC related data. Immunohistochemistry The proteins under evaluation were detected by previously standardised immunohistochemical techniques using: (i) The purified rabbit polyclonal antibody MAP1LCA (AP1805a, Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA) raised against a synthetic peptide at the C-terminal cleavage site of the human cleaved-LC3A (APG8a). This antibody was used at 1?:?20 dilution, as recently described (Cufi et al, 2012). This antibody recognises specifically the A and not the B variant in western blot experiments against human recombinant proteins LC3A (H00084557-P01, Abnova, Heidelberg, Germany) and LC3B (H00081631-P01, Abnova) (Koukourakis et al, 2013). (ii) The mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; LC3B 5F10 Nanotools). This antibody recognises specifically the B and not the A variant in western blot experiments (data not shown). (iii) The Ki67 monoclonal antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) recognising the MIB1 antigen was used to assess cancer cell proliferation. This was used at a dilution of 1?:?75 and 75?min incubation. (iv) The ESEE122 mouse monoclonal antibody (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) was used to assess the expression of HIF1? transcription factor, at a dilution of 1?:?20 and overnight incubation. (v) For the assessment of the glucose absorption ability of cancer cells we used the ab652 (Abcam, UK; 1?:?100) monoclonal rabbit antibody recognising the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein. This was used at a dilution of 1?:?100 and overnight incubation. (vi) HER2/c-erbB-2 membrane protein expression was assessed using the monoclonal NCL-CB11 antibody, in double immunostaining with LC3A and LC3B, so we could further assess the percentage of HERr2+ cells expressing LC3A or LC3B and the response of this subpopulation to Trastuzumab. The limited material available from the pre-chemotherapy biopsy-obtained tissue did not allow the study of eventually additional important markers related to pH regulation, respiration, glycolysis and autophagy flux. Briefly, tissue sections were cut at 3??m from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours and mounted on poly-L-lysine coated glass slides. They were subsequently dewaxed and rehydrated in graded alcohols. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was achieved by placing the sections in citrate buffer (1?:?10 dilution, pH 7.2) and heated at 120?�C for 3 � 5?min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was neutralised using peroxidase block for 5?min. The non-specific binding was blocked by preincubation with protein block for 5?min at room temperature (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The slides were then incubated with the primary antibodies at dilutions and times indicated above. After washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2 � 5?min), the sections were incubated with post primary block (that enhances penetration of the subsequent polymer agent) for 30?min at room temperature (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd). They were subsequently washed in PBS for 2 � 5?min and incubated with NovoLink polymer for 30?min at room temperature (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd). This recognises mouse and rabbit immunoglobulins and detects any tissue-bound primary antibody. After thorough washing in PBS (2 � 5?min), the colour reaction was developed in 3,3?-diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 5?min. The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted.

Breast_Cancer "In every staining run one component of the sequential staining reaction was omitted from at least one section, this usually being the omission of the primary antibody and its replacement by normal species-specific immunoglobulin-G. Evaluation of the protein expression For LC3A and LC3B expression, the percentage of cells with strong cytoplasmic expression was recorded in all optical fields and the mean value for each case was calculated for continuous variable analysis. Double immunohistochemical staining for HER2/LC3A and HER2/LC3B was performed, so we could further assess the percentage of HER2+ cells expressing LC3A or LC3B and the response of this subpopulation to Trastuzumab. For Ki67 cancer cell proliferation index the percentage of cells with nuclear MIB1 expression was recorded in all optical fields and the mean value for each case was calculated for continuous variable analysis. For HIF1? protein expression the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic and with nuclear MIB1 expression was separately assessed in all optical fields and the mean value for each case was calculated for continuous variable analysis. For GLUT1 expression the percentage of cells with membrane immunoreactivity was recorded in all optical fields and the mean value for each case was calculated for continuous variable analysis. Cytoplasmic staining was disregarded. For group analysis, the median value was taken into account to define groups of low vs high reactivity. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 5.01 package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA; www.graphpad.com). The Fisher's exact test or the paired and unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for testing relationships between categorical or continuous variable groups, as appropriate. Linear regression analysis was used to assess correlation between continuous variables. A P-value ?0.05 was considered significant. Results Immunohistochemistry analysis The percentage of cells with strong cytoplasmic LC3A or LC3B protein expression ranged between 0 and 100 among cases (median 30). The percentage of cancer cells with double HER2/LC3A reactivity ranged from 0% to 90% (median 30). The percentage of cancer cells with double HER2/LC3B reactivity ranged from 0% to 90% (median 20). Figure 1A�C show typical images of double and single antibody reactivity on cancer cells. Cytoplasmic HIF1? expression ranged from 0% to 100% (median 10), while nuclear expression ranged from 0% to 50% (median 0). Figure 1D and E shows two cases with low and high mixed HIF1? cytoplasmic and nuclear reactivity. Membrane GLUT1 expression was noted in 0�80% of cells (median 22). Figure 1F and G shows a typical image of low and high membrane GLUT1 expression. For proliferation index, the nuclear Ki67 expression was used by grouping cases according to the median value of 28% of positive cells (?28 vs >28). Linear regression analysis between variables revealed interesting correlations. The LC3A/HER2+ cell population was correlated with HIF1? expression (P=0.01, r=0.45), while GLUT1 and LC3B expression correlated with Ki67 proliferation index (P=0.01, r=0.47 and P=0.01, r=0.45, respectively; Figure 2A�C. A significant association between LC3A and LC3B was also found (P=0.01, r=0.38). PET vs histology and immunohistochemical variables Tumour dimensions as assessed by PET imaging ranged from 10 to 68?mm (median 23?mm). In linear regression analysis, PET dimensions were also correlated with advanced T-stage (P=0.01, r=0.21), high histology grade (P=0.05, r=0.38) and with LC3B expression (P=0.005, r=0.27). In group analysis (T1, 2 vs T3, 4), the association of PET dimensions with T-stage did not reach significance (P=0.09; Figure 2D), whereas a strong correlation with high Ki67 proliferation index was documented (P=0.0009; Figure 2E). Similarly, tumours with high LC3B levels were significantly larger in PET images (P=0.05; Figure 2F) No significant association was recorded for the rest of the variables. SUVmax ranged from 2.1 to 15.7 (median 7.5) and linear regression analysis showed a correlation with PET size (P=0.01, r=0.48). The only other association was a correlation with the percentage of HER2-positive cells (P=0.05, r=0.33). There was no association with T-stage, Ki67 index and LC3B staining (Figure 2D�F) or with any other variable. Response to Trastuzumab Administration of Trastuzumab significantly reduced overall tumour dimensions, whether assessed clinically (39.9�2 vs 28.7�22; P=0.01) or with PET (28.7�2 vs 23.2�1; P=0.004); Figure 3A. There was also a significant reduction of the SUV values (7.8�3 vs 4.7�3; P<00001); Figure 3B. Figure 3C shows individual changes of SUVmax, before and after Trastuzumab administration. The effect of the pathology variables on response to Trastuzumab and on SUVmax was studied. The percentage of clinical or PET-assessed tumour response was calculated as the ratio �(initial dimensions?final dimensions)/initial dimensions'. A similar ratio was also calculated for the SUV reduction. Using this ratio, we assessed the percentage of tumour (or SUV) reduction after Trastuzumab administration. Linear regression analysis of response revealed a significant association of the percentage reduction of clinical dimensions with percentage reduction of PET dimension and SUV (Figure 3D and E). A significant inverse association of the baseline percentage of HIF1?+ cells with reduction of clinical dimensions was confirmed (Figure 3F), showing an important association of HIF1? expression with resistance of breast cancer to Trastuzumab therapy. Group analysis, using 50% reduction as a cutoff point to define tumours with low vs high HIF1? reactivity, confirmed a significant association of high HIF1? with resistant tumours (P=0.01); Figure 3G. The association of SUVmax reduction with the percentage of HER2+ cells was not significant (P=0.08; Figure 3H). Effect of Trastuzumab on the expression of autophagy, proliferation markers and HER2 Tru-cut biopsies obtained on day 21 following administration of Trastuzumab were immunohistochemically analysed. Administration of Trastuzumab resulted in a significant decrease of the proliferation index (29.7�15 vs 24.4�15; P=0.004), and of GLUT1 expression (28�22 vs 13�18; P=0.04); Figure 4A), whereas there was no significant effect on HIF1? expression (42�36 vs 36�35; P=0.75). A significant reduction of the HER2+ cell population in the tumours was noted (89�21 vs 70�38; P=0.01; Figure 4B) after exposure to Trastuzumab. The percentage of cells with LC3A expression was significantly increased after therapy (26�21 vs 49�26; P=0.005; Figure 4B). There was no difference in LC3B-positive cells (31�27 vs 27�24; P=0.85; Figure 4B). In double immunostaining, focusing on the total cell population, the percentage of cells expressing simultaneously HER2 and LC3A was increased after the administration of Trastuzumab (30�23 vs 43�29; P=0.01; Figure 4C). Such a difference was not shown for the HER2+/LC3B cell population (45�36 vs 49�35; P=0.16; Figure 4C). Response to taxol plus Trastuzumab therapy The response rate (RR) as assessed by comparing the maximal two-dimensional size of post-operative tumour samples with the initial (pre-Trastuzumab) clinically assessed dimensions ranged from 0% to 100%, with a median value of 70%. The RR was calculated as the ratio �(initial clinical dimensions?final surgical dimensions)/initial clinical dimensions'. Using this value two groups were formed (low vs high RR). Group analysis revealed a significant association of high-baseline (pre-Trastuzumab) HIF1? expression with low RR (P=0.001) and of high-baseline PgR, but not ER, expression with high RR (P=0.04); Figure 4D and E. No further associations were documented. Discussion Identification of molecular pathways involved in resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies and molecular targeted therapies is of high clinical relevance. Effective restoration of cancer cell sensitivity would improve survival in a poor prognosis subgroup of breast cancer patients, composing ?30% of the total patient population. Signalling pathways involving PTEN, SRC, the Akt kinase or the c-met proteins have been identified as major determinants of resistance to anti-HER2 therapies (Nagata et al, 2004; Narayan et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2011; Minuti et al, 2012). In the current prospective clinicopathological study we investigated metabolism and autophagy-related tumour features that could influence clinical response to Trastuzumab and to Trastuzumab plus taxol. Immunohistochemical analysis of pre-Trastuzumab tumour biopsies revealed that a tumour subpopulation of HER2+/LC3A+ cells, that is, HER2+ cells with high LC3A autophagic activity, was strongly associated with the overexpression of HIF1?. The direct association between HIF1a and HIF2a expression with HER2 in breast cancer has been previously reported (Bos et al, 2003; Giatromanolaki et al, 2006). HER2 overexpression has been previously shown to directly regulate synthesis of HIF1? and it was shown that HIF1? directly induces mitophagy through BNIP3 (Laughner et al, 2001; Bellot et al, 2009). Of interest, Whelan et al (2013) demonstrate that ERBB2 requires HIF1 for tumour growth and that HIF is a major downstream regulator of HER2, protecting breast cancer cells from anoikis and metabolic stress. HIF1 and LC3 autophagy have been also shown to be involved in cancer�stem cell phenotype induction (Zhu et al, 2013). Overexpression of HIF1 and anaerobic metabolism has been persistently linked with LC3A expression in a large number of studies performed by our group in different tumour types (Giatromanolaki et al, 2010; Giatromanolaki et al, 2011; Giatromanolaki et al, 2013). Thus, there is strong evidence linking anaerobic metabolism, LC3A and HER2 expression in the literature. Of interest, high expression of LC3B, an additional marker of autophagosomal formation, was associated with high proliferation index; the latter correlated with overexpression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Moreover, increased PET scan tumour dimensions were associated with LC3B overexpression. These are in accordance with a study by Lazova et al (2012) where LC3B was linked with high proliferation in solid tumours including breast cancer. Overall, the findings confirm a close link between hypoxia, glycolytic metabolism and active autophagic pathways in HER2+ breast cancer. However, they indicate that the autophagy pathway may have more complex links because of the heterogeneity of expression and correlations of atg8-related group of homologous proteins, LC3A and B, with the other pathways. Comparative study of pre-Trastuzumab and post-Trastuzumab tumour biopsies obtained 21 days after administration revealed important transitions of the immunohistochemical profile. Trastuzumab therapy resulted in decrease of HER2 expression in the tumour. This was possibly a result of direct cytotoxic effect on HER2+ cells, which is supported by the reduction on tumour dimensions 21 days post-therapy. The proliferation index was sharply reduced as a result of exposure to Trastuzumab. Of interest, the LC3A and the HER2+/LC3A+ subpopulation was significantly more abundant in the post-Trastuzumab biopsies. Taking into account that the HER2+/LC3A+ cell population increases after Trastuzumab, on a background of an overall decrease of HER2+ total population, we suggest that breast cancer cells expressing LC3A are resistant to Trastuzumab cytotoxic effect and persist in post-therapy biopsies. LC3A-dependent autophagy may therefore define resistance to Trastuzumab. Of interest, two important studies in the literature support the hypothesis that autophagy is involved in breast cancer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies (Vazquez-Martin et al, 2009; Cufi et al, 2012). An additional study supports that macro-autophagy is also involved in the resistance of cancer cells to tamoxifen (Qadir et al, 2008), suggesting that autophagy, and presumably LC3A-targeting agents, may prove to be of importance in both breast cancer chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. The observation that, in contrast to LC3B, only LC3A is linked with HER2 expression and with resistance of HER2+ cells to Trastuzumab is interesting and demands further investigation. Nevertheless, LC3B is also an important autophagy marker, and was strongly associated with cancer cell proliferation and tumour dimensions, and thus growth. This emerging different biological role of the two LC3s is not surprising. Our group has persistently studied and reported that LC3A and LC3B are not at all identical. Even in normal tissues, according to immunoblotting work, the LC3A protein follows discrete patterns of LC3A-I and LC3A-II changes in liver, lung, kidney and heart tissues of mice, whereas the LC3B protein does not follow the same pattern under stressed conditions, showing a cell type-specific function of these two molecules (Zois et al, 2011)."
Breast_Cancer "In confocal microscopy in breast and many other cancer cell lines, LC3A and LC3B autophagosomes are not identical and present different subcellular distribution (submitted data). Moreover, a widespread confusion on the role of LC3A vs LC3B autophagy in cancer exists because of the usage of antibodies that either recognise both LC3 forms or erroneously are believed to recognise only LC3B (Koukourakis et al, 2013). In fact, there is growing evidence that the biology behind LC3A-mediated autophagy is not identical to the LC3B one. The observation that LC3A is associated with HER2 in breast cancer as noted in the current study is preliminary and will need further study. On the other hand, LC3B autophagy seems also to be important in breast cancer biology, although rather less related to HER2. Trastuzumab induced a significant reduction of tumour size in terms of both clinical and PET measurements. SUVmax was also significantly reduced, in accordance to the reduction of tumour proliferation, as assessed with immunohistochemistry. Among the immunohistochemical variables assessed, the overexpression of HIF1? was strongly correlated with the resistance of breast tumours to Trastuzumab. In a recent study HIF1? has been shown to be essential for the growth effect of HER2 activation in breast cancer (Whelan et al, 2013). Blocking HIF1? helped to overcome resistance of hepatoma or lung cancer cells to multikinase or EGFR inhibitors (Minakata et al, 2012; Liang et al, 2013). In our study, HIF1? was further found to be the only important factor predicting poor response of HER2-positive tumours to Trastuzumab plus Taxol, which may a direct effect on increasing intrinsic cancer cell chemoresistance. Indeed, this latter effect of HIF1? has been confirmed for cisplatin and doxorubicin in lung cancer cells (Song et al, 2006). As the HIF1? expression did not change significantly on Trastuzumab, even though the percentage of HER2- and GLUT1 (a HIF1? target gene)-positive cells went down, this implies additional mechanisms besides HER2 or hypoxia driving HIF1? (e.g., other upstream signalling pathways such as Akt and mTOR). The relation of PgR with overall response to Trastuzumab plus Taxol demands further investigation. The results of the current study, although based on limited material and being certainly of preliminary nature, provide clinical evidence to add to previous experimental data that support a role of autophagy as a contributor to resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer to Trastuzumab. Moreover, the study suggests that HIF1? expression may serve as a baseline biomarker of resistance to Trastuzumab. The HER2+/LC3A+ phenotype, which often overexpressed HIF1?, was revealed as a major subpopulation refractory to Trastuzumab alone. This suggests that LC3A and HIF1?-targeting therapies may prove critical for the augmentation of anti-HER2 therapy efficacy. Further experimental studies are now needed to follow up these observations before scheduling randomised trials investigating the value of autophagy inhibitors in trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.

However, these trials were performed at sites where conventional mammographic screening was concurrently performed, possibly leading to selection biases or with complex, multireader algorithms not reflecting general clinical practice. Our study reports the impact on screening outcomes for DBT screening implemented in an entire clinic population. Methods Recall rates, cancer detection, and positive predictive values of screening were compared for 15571 women screened with DBT and 10728 screened with DM alone prior to DBT implementation at a single breast imaging center. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for recall rate adjusted for age, race, presence of prior mammograms, breast density and reader. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results DBT screening showed a statistically significant reduction in recalls compared to DM alone. For the entire population, there were 16 fewer recalls (8.8% vs 10.4%, P <.001, adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 0.88, P < .001) and 0.9 additional cancers detected per 1000 screened with DBT compared to DM alone. There was a statistically significant increase in PPV1 (6.2% vs 4.4%, P = .047). In women younger than age 50 years screened with DBT, there were 17 fewer recalls (12.3% vs 14.0%, P = .02) and 3.6 additional cancer detected per 1000 screened (5.7 vs 2.2 per 1000, P = .02). "
Breast_Cancer " Conclusions Our data support the clinical implementation of DBT in breast cancer screening; however, larger prospective trials are needed to validate our findings in specific patient subgroups.

Background Waterlily Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is thought to be antioxidant-rich, conferred by its functional phytochemicals. Methods The potential anticancer effects of the ethanolic kernel extract on breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) using MTT, anti-proliferation, neutral red (NR) uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays were evaluated. Cytological studies on the breast cancer cells were also conducted, and phytochemical analyses of the extract were carried out to determine the likely bioactive compounds responsible for such effects. Results Results showed the extract induced cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 30 and 15 ?g/mL, respectively. The extract showed significant toxicity towards both cell lines, with low toxicity to normal breast cells (MCF-10A). The cytotoxic effects on the cells were further confirmed by the NR uptake, antiproliferative and LDH release assays. Bioactive analyses revealed that many bioactives were present in the extract although butylated hydroxytoluene, a potent antioxidant, was the most abundant with 44.65%. Conclusions M. indica extract appears to be more cytoxic to both estrogen positive and negative breast cancer cell lines than to normal breast cells. Synergistic effects of its antioxidant bioactives could have contributed to the cytotoxic effects of the extract. The extract of M. indica, therefore, has potential anticancer activity against breast cancer cells. This potential is worth studying further, and could have implications on future studies and eventually management of human breast cancers. Mangifera indica L kernel extract MCF-7 cells MDA-MB-231 cell Cytotoxicity Anticancer activity Background Breast cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among women [1], and metastasis mainly affects outcome of the disease [2]. Lack of effective therapeutic strategies for control and treatment of breast cancers, and the huge financial burden placed on individuals and nations mean urgent action must be taken in the fight against breast cancer. Also, side effects due to conventional pharmacological agents have necessitated the search for newer therapies mostly in the form of natural products. In recent years, interest in natural products has grown, and in the light of long-term and safe cancer prevention, current approaches have been focused on the use of food and edible medicinal herbs as sources of products that could effectively control cancers [3-5]. This is evident by the fact that approximately 74% of new anticancer compounds are either natural products or natural product-derived [6-9]. In fact, it has been argued that plants may be sources of multiple bioactive compounds that could provide more benefit than single pharmacological agents against chronic diseases, and this may well be beneficical in managing breast cancer. The antioxidant potentials of plant bioresources, mainly contributed by their bioactive compounds, have been closely linked to their abilities to suppress growth of cancer cells, likely through reduced oxidative stress, which may play a role in the development and progression of cellular damages underlying cancerous growth. As such, it has been suggested that antioxidant supplementation may reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortalities [10] and through bioassay systems and animal studies, there have been indications that numerous naturally-occurring antioxidant compounds possess anticancer properties [11,12]. In particular, consumption of foods and beverages rich in polyphenols such as catechins, antocyanines and flavones have been linked to lower occurrence of cancers [13]. Other phenolic compounds claimed to possess biological activities include coumarins, lignans, phenolic acids, flavonoids, quinones, stilbenes, tannins and curcuminoids [14]. Mangifera indica L. is a popular fruit crop in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, specifically Asia, because of its characteristic taste, colour and nutritional value [15,16]. It has numerous classes of bioactive compounds and vitamins with different health-promoting characteristics [17]. The ethanolic extract of its peel was observed to have great antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties, attributed to its phenolic content [18,19]. Notwithstanding these reports however, the phytochemical profile or therapeutic potential of compounds in the kernel has not been studied. Thus, the phytochemical profile and the potential cytotoxic effects of the kernel extract towards breast cancer cell lines were studied and evaluated. Methods Chemicals and reagents Dulbecco�s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), thiazoyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT), 95% ethanol, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) NADH, fetal bovine serum (FBS), phosphate buffer saline (PBS), trypan blue dye solution, trypsin-EDTA, neutral red (NR) solution and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Raw materials Waterlily mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruits were procured from a local market in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and were identified by a resident botanist and voucher specimen (Mr. Shamsul Khamis) from Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia under the voucher specimen (SK2448/14).The mango kernel was manually isolated from the stone and flesh. Preparation of crude extract M. indica kernels were soaked in water, and washed to remove adhering flesh. They were then air-dried, and subsequently kept in an oven at 45�C for 2 days. The dried kernels were finely ground with a Waring blender 7011HS (Osaka Chemical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and stored at 4�C until analysis. Ethanol (95%) was added to the kernel powder at 10:1 (v/w) and the mixture shaken continuously at 200 rpm and 37�C for 24 h in an incubator shaker (INNOVA 4000, New Jersey, USA). Insoluble materials were then removed by filtration and the filtrates centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm using Benchtop Centrifuge Z200A (Labnet International, Inc., Woodbridge, NJ, USA). The residues were discarded and the supernatant dried using 1 L Rotary Evaporator N1001S-WD (Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) until the extract was fully concentrated. After determining the yield, the concentrated extract was then dissolved in DMSO and stored in a freezer at -20�C [20] before further analyses. In vitro assay Two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and one normal cell line, MCF-10A cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC: Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin) in an incubator at 37�C with 5% CO2. MTT assay MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells were seeded into 96-well plates at densities of 2?�?103/well under 5% CO2 at 37�C for 24 h as reported previously [21]. The cells were then either treated with different concentrations of ethanolic extract of the M. indica kernel (10-1000 ?g/mL) or doxorubicin (0.1-10 ?g/mL) as positive control. After 72 h incubation, 20 ?L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was pipetted into each well and incubated for another 4 h. The medium was later discarded and the formazan precipitate was dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance of the mixtures was determined using a microtiter plate reader at 570 and 630 nm (background) and the cell viability expressed as percentage of live cells relative to controls. All experiments were performed in triplicates. The IC50 was generated from the dose�response curve for each cell line. Anti-proliferation assay MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at densities of 1?�?104 cells/well and allowed to incubate for 24 h for cell attachment. These exponentially growing cells were then exposed to 5, 10 and 50 ?g/mL concentrations of the extract and the plates incubated at 37�C under 5% CO2, for 24, 48, and 72 h. At the end of the incubation periods, the medium was aspirated off and washed with cold PBS followed by the addition of 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. The plates were then incubated at 37�C for 15 min and after majority of the cells had detached from the plate, they were harvested by spinning the suspension for 10 min at 1000 rpm using Benchtop Centrifuge Z200A (Labnet International, Inc., Woodbridge, NJ, USA) and the supernatant discarded. Twenty microliters of the cell pellet were re-suspended in 20 ?L of 0.4% trypan blue solution. The dye-excluding viable cells were counted microscopically using a hemocytometer, and expressed as percent of control cells that were still viable. Neutral red uptake assay The cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37�C under 5% CO2 until they reached 60% confluence. The medium was then discarded and replaced with 200 ?L of fresh growth medium containing the same concentrations of the kernel extract as that used in the MTT assay. Untreated cells under the same conditions were used as controls. "
Breast_Cancer " The plates were incubated at 37�C under 5% CO2 for 24, 48 and 72 h and the cells were then washed three times with 200 ?L of PBS. The plates were re-incubated for 3 h at 25�C in medium containing 200 ?L NR solutions, and the cells subsequently washed to remove the NR solution. Cells were then exposed to fixing solution consisting of 1% CaCl2 and 0.5% formaldehyde in milli-Q water for 2 min followed by two washes with 1% acetic acid and 50% ethanol in milli-Q water. After a second wash, the plates were incubated for 10 min and then read in a microplate reader at 540 nm. Lactate dehydrogenase release assay The permeability of the cell membrane of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines after treatment with ethanolic kernel extract was determined by LDH release assay. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 100 ?L of media, and then treated with different concentrations of ethanolic extract of the M. indica kernel (10�1000 ?g/mL) or doxorubicin (0.1-100 ?g/mL). The treated cells then were incubated for 18 h, after which 40 ?L of the medium was transferred to a new 96-well plate and further incubated for 72 h to determine LDH release. Forty microliter of 6% triton X-100 was added to the original 96-well plates to determine the total LDH concentration. An aliquot of 100 ?L of 4.6 mM pyruvic acid in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was added to each well of the plate containing the medium followed by 100 ?L of 0.4 mg/mL reduced ?-NADH in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The kinetic change in absorbance at 340 nm was read for 1 min in an ELISA microplate reader. Change in 0.001 absorbance unit/min was considered to be equivalent to 1 U/L of LDH activity [21]. To determine total LDH activity, the procedure was repeated with 40 ?L total cell lysate from untreated controls following similar way as stated above. The LDH release was determined as percentage of LDH in medium in comparison to total LDH in cell lysate of each respective well using the following equation: 100%* LDHout/(LDHout?+?LDHin). Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev. (n?=?3). Bioactive compounds analysis The crude ethanolic extract of Waterlily kernel (100 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of hexane and 100 ?L of 2 N potassium hydroxide in methanol was added to the mixture and vortexed for 30 sec. The solution was further separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant (1.5 mL) was transferred into a vial and analyzed using Gas chromatography�mass spectrometry following the method of Hema et al. [22]. The analysis of the extract was performed using a Perkin-Elmer GC claurus 500 system. The gas chromatograph was interfaced to a mass spectrometer, equipped with Elite-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m � 0.25 mm ID � 1 ?m df, composed of 100% Dimethyl poly siloxane). Compounds were detected using an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV. Helium gas (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min and an injection volume of 0.5 ?L, with a split ratio of 10:1. The injector temperature was 250�C while that of the ion source was 280�C. The oven temperature was set at 110�C held for 2 min with an increase of 10�C/min to 200�C, then at 5�C/min to 280�C held for 9 min. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV; a scan interval of 0.5 sec and fragments from 45 to 450 Da. Total GC running time was 60 min. Interpretation of mass spectrum from GC-MS was conducted using the database of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The spectra of the unknown compounds were compared with those of the known compounds stored in the NIST library. The name, molecular weight and structure of the compounds extracted from the test materials were ascertained. Results and discussion MTT assay Two human breast carcinoma cell lines, estrogen receptor negative (ER-) MDA-MB-231 cells and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 cells were used to determine the cytotoxicity of the M. indica kernel extract against the cells. Non-tumorous MCF-10A cells were used as controls. The survival of the three human breast-derived cells after treatment with the kernel extract and doxorubicin after 72 h was determined. The responses of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to increasing concentrations of the kernel extract and doxorubicin are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The results showed the tendency of both cell lines to decrease sharply upon treatment with low extract and doxorubicin concentrations, with a tapering response intensity as the concentrations of the extract and doxorubicin were increased. Figure 1 Viability of MCF-7 cells after 72 hours treatment with (A) doxorubicin and, (B) M. indica kernel extract. Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev (n?=?3). Figure 2 Viability of MDA-MB-231 cells after 72 hour treatment with (A) doxorubicin and, (B) M. indica kernel extract. Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev. (n?=?3). Following 72 h incubation with 15.6 ?g/mL of the extract, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell retained 53 and 76% viability, respectively, indicating decrease in cell growth by 47 and 24% for the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell, respectively. The MCF-10A cells similarly treated with kernel extract showed only 7% decrease in growth thereby retaining 93% viability (Figure 3). This insignificant decrease in growth of MCF-10A 223 as compared to considerably higher values seen in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 indicates that the extract exhibited low toxicity towards normal cells and significantly higher toxicity towards the cancer cells. The IC50 values of the kernel extract after 72 h treatment ranged between 15 and 30 ?g/mL for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, while it was found to be significantly higher (149 ?g/mL) for the normal MCF-10A cells (Figure 4). The kernel extract showed lower IC50 values for the cancer cells compared to the normal breast cell, suggesting that the extract could have huge potentials as an anti-cancer agent. These findings mirrored those of Abu Bakar et al. [23], who demonstrated the anti-cancer potentials of the seed kernel of Mangifera pajang (Banbangan) on the same type of cell lines following similar treatments. Figure 3 Viability of MCF-10A cells after 72 hour treatment with (A) doxorubicin and, (B) M. indica kernel extract. Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev. (n?=?3). Figure 4 Scatter plot showing viability of breast cancer cells treated with doxorubicin or M. indica kernel extract after 72 hours. Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev (n?=?3). Anti-proliferation assay Figure 5 illustrates the anti-proliferative effects of the kernel extract on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The percentage survival of the MCF-7 cells after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation with 10 ?g/mL of extract were 96, 77 and 52%, respectively. However, MDA-MB-231 cells similarly treated with the kernel extract did not show as much reduction in viability as the MCF-7 cells with values of 98, 93 and 71%, respectively. This indicated that the kernel extract could have greater effect on the viability of MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231 cells.

NR uptake The NR assay used to determine lysosomal activity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the kernel extract showed lower sensitivity than the MTT assay although a significant decrease in lysosomal activity in a dose-dependent manner was observed (Figure 6). The lower sensitivity may be due to the lower numbers of lysosomes in the breast cancer cell lines. NR uptake assay is based on the capacity of viable cells to bind and incorporate the supravital dye, NR, into lysosomes. NR is a positively charged dye that passively diffuses across cellular membrane and accumulates in the lysosomes, and the intensity of its staining is directly proportional to the number of viable cells.

Values are expressed as mean?�?std. dev. (n?=?3). LDH release assay Cell death in culture was also determined by the release of LDH into the incubation medium. The LDH release curves for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with different concentrations of the kernel extract suggested that the cytotoxic effect of the extract was concentration-dependent (Figure 7). The percentage of LDH release from MCF-7 cell lines after 72 h exposure to 15, 31, 62, and 125 ?g/mL extract concentrations were 57, 73, 81 and 86%, respectively. This effect is greater than those observed for the same concentration of extract on MDA-MB-231 cell lines with 42, 58, 72 and 85%, respectively after 72 h. However, higher concentrations (250�1000 ?g/mL) of the extract produced even greater LDH release on both cells.

In addition, the other compounds have also been shown to exhibit some biological activities including antioxidant activity. Phenol, 4,6-di (1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-methyl- also known as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was found to be the most abundant in the extract, and is a common food additive that is reported to have high antioxidant potentials. It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and other industries largely due to its antioxidant properties. Apigenin 7-glucoside, a phenolic compound with potent antioxidant and anticancer potentials [30], was also found to be present in the extract. It is most probable that the cytotoxic effects of the extract of Mangifera indica L. on breast cancer cells as shown in this study are due to more than one bioactive compound in view of the multiple compounds detected in the extract and since a crude extract was used. Already, some of the compounds found in the extract have been reported to have effects favorable for an anticancer activity, and these effects could have been synergistically contributed to the anticancer potentials observed in the extract. Conclusions The MTT, anti-proliferation, NR uptake and LDH release assays used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of ethanolic kernel extract of Mangifera indica L on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed that the extract is significantly cytotoxic to these cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and considerably less so towards normal breast cells MCF-10A. These findings highlights the potentials of Mangifera indica L extract in the treatment of breast cancer. Its therapeutic potential is huge and can be used as alternative to or supplementation for the various therapy currently used in the treatment of breast cancer. However there is a need to identify the actual components responsible for this cytotoxicity and to isolate them and to study their effect in vivo to ascertain their efficacies and or any side effects. The concerns of side effects with pharmacological agents, and growing interest in plant bioresources for treatment of cancers mean this extract could have important role in future studies on the mangement of breast cancer.

Breast_Cancer "We investigated the correlation between early optical response to single-agent bevacizumab and treatment outcome. Methods Seven patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer were treated with single-agent bevacizumab followed by addition of weekly paclitaxel. Optical imaging of patient's breasts was performed to measure tumor total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) and oxygen saturation (stO2) at baseline and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the first infusion of bevacizumab. To assess early metabolic response, 2-deoxy-2-(18F)-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET/CT, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline and after two cycles of the regimen. Results Seven patients were grouped as responders (n?=?4) and nonresponders (n?=?3) on the basis of metabolic response measured by FDG-PET/CT. The responders showed remarkable tumor shrinkage and low accumulations of FMISO tracer relative to those of the nonresponders at the completion of two cycles of chemotherapy. Tumors of both groups showed remarkable attenuation of mean tHb as early as day 1 after therapy initiation. The nonresponders had lower baseline stO2 levels compared with adjacent breast tissue stO2 levels along with a pattern of steadily low stO2 levels during the observation window. On the other hand, the responders appeared to sustain high stO2 levels with temporal fluctuation. Conclusions Low tumor stO2 level after single-agent bevacizumab treatment was characteristic of the nonresponders. Tumor stO2 level could be a predictor of an additional benefit of bevacizumab over that provided by paclitaxel.

Introduction Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in patients with HER2 negative breast cancer [1],[2]. To date, although it is believed that a particular subset of patients could greatly benefit from early adoption of bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy, no specific biomarkers for assessing bevacizumab response have been consistently validated [3]. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is a noninvasive imaging technology using near-infrared light that can measure tissue hemoglobin concentration obtained from spectroscopic oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) data as well as directly visualize vascularity and tissue oxygenation indicated from tHb (O2Hb+HHb) and stO2 (O2Hb/tHb), respectively [4],[5]. DOSI has been currently integrated into several clinical neoadjuvant studies that have explored hemodynamic biomarkers for predicting early treatment response [6],[7],[8]. Zhu et al. reported that remarkable reduction in tumor tHb of primary breast cancer after early treatment cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy could predict favorable pathological outcome [7]. In a separate study, Roblyer et al. reported that transient increase in O2Hb on day 1 after chemotherapy initiation was characteristic of responders but not nonresponders [8]. These results suggested the clinical importance of tumor oxygenation response to chemotherapy sensitivity. Jain first proposed a therapeutic concept with bevacizumab involving a �normalization window� of tumor vasculature in which more accurate remodeling of the disorganized structure and abnormal functioning of tumor vessels would improve perfusion and enhance tissue oxygenation, which would result in more efficient delivery of cytotoxic drugs [9]. We hypothesized that if vascular normalization occurs after successful vascular remodeling, tumor tHb level should decrease and stO2 level should simultaneously improve. In this clinical study, we used DOSI to monitor tumor mean tHb and stO2 levels after the initiation of single-agent bevacizumab followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer and determined if early changes in tHb and stO2 over a period of single-agent bevacizumab administration could be a predictor of treatment response. Materials and Methods From October 2012 through December 2013, we enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer (TNM stage III or IV) to receive a combination chemotherapy regimen with paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy before participating in this study were also included. Patient history, including histopathological and radiological imaging results and Ki67 proliferative index, was obtained from medical records. The treatment regimen reported in the study was standard care. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to inclusion (12-084). Chemotherapy regimen All patients received bevacizumab (5 mg/kg body weight) intravenously on days 1 and 15 in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 body surface area) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks (Figure 1) [10]. Paclitaxel infusion was omitted on the first day of the first cycle. Dexamethasone (6.6 mg) and an H2 antagonist were used for supportive treatment during the course of chemotherapy; however, use of these drugs in the first infusion of bevazicumab was omitted. Breast surgery was performed for patients deemed resectable after 5�6 weeks of completion of the initial chemotherapy. Treatment continued for six cycles unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. If study treatment was discontinued, further local and/or systemic treatment was permitted at the investigator's discretion. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.g001 Figure 1 The schedule of treatment and imaging tests. Schematic of combination treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. All patients received bevacizumab (5 mg/kg body weight) intravenously on days 1 and 15 in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 body surface area) on days 1, 8, and 15 and repeated every 4 weeks. Subsequently, the patients underwent 5 additional cycles of bevacizumab and paclitaxel. Both before treatment and after the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy, the patients underwent MRI, FDG-PET/CT, and FMISO-PET/CT. Imaging using diffuse optical spectroscopy was also performed on day 1 before the first infusion of bevacizumab and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the infusion. TRS breast imaging system To extract quantitative hemoglobin concentrations from breast tissue, we developed a system that used a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method for measuring temporal response profiles of tissue against optical pulse inputs and enabled quantitative analysis of light absorption and scattering in tissue according to the photon diffusion theory [4],[11]. This approach could quantify O2Hb and HHb tissue levels. Details of the TRS breast imaging system have been previously published [12]. An ultrasound-assisted optical probe was used to visualize the largest tumor lesions, which were located in the center of a 10-mm square grid map that was constructed for the lesion and surrounding normal tissue. The grid map of a tumor-bearing breast basically comprised 7�7 points with a 10-mm interval between two points in the x�y dimension. For spline interpolation, custom software (DataBreastViewer, version 109; SincereTechnology Corp., Kanagawa, Japan) was used to perform 2D image processing and analysis. Hemodynamic biomarkers The distribution of tHb levels of a tumor-bearing breast shows the functional vascular tumor volume, which is contrasted by that of the surrounding normal tissue. The distribution of stO2 levels maps the magnitude of tissue oxygenation of breast tissue. A lesional region of interest (ROI) 2 cm in radius from the center of the tumor was constructed, and the mean levels of tHb and stO2 were calculated. To demonstrate the capacity of DOSI to reveal the tumor response of bevacizumab, we monitored changes in the mean levels of tHb and stO2 of a tumor-bearing breast and a normal contralateral breast at baseline (day -1) and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the first infusion of bevacizumab. Serial examination of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) Biograph 6 (Siemens, Medical Systems, Inc.:Suite, Washinton, D.C., United States) was used to perform PET/CT. Details of the FDG PET/CT procedure have been described previously [13] [14]. All patients were required to fast for at least 6 h to confirm normal glucose blood levels. One hour after the administration of FDG tracer (3.7 MBq/kg), the patients were positioned prone on the whole-body PET/CT scanner couch. CT was initially performed followed by a PET emission scan that covered the identical transverse field of view. The Biograph allows simultaneous collection of 16 slices over a span of 15.8 mm with a slice thickness of 2.5 mm and a transaxial resolution of 6.3 mm. The acquisition time was 2 min per table positron. PET scans were processed, reconstructed with an ordered subset expectation maximization, and measured attenuation correction. Ordered subset expectation maximization image reconstruction was used for all data. Acquisition of PET data was operated in three-dimensional and high resolution mode. According to protocol, FMISO-PET/CT scan was basically performed 1 day after the FDG-PET/CT scan. All patients were intravenously injected with 7.4 MBq/kg of FMISO. At 2 h after injection, FMISO-PET/CT was performed immediately after the CT scan. ROIs with 1.0-cm maximum diameters were drawn on the areas of abnormal FDG or FMISO accumulation corresponding to the baseline tumor lesions. In a series of PET/CT scans, care was taken to draw the ROI in the same lesion as shown on the baseline lesion. For deciding each ROI, CT combined with PET provided anatomical landmarks for detecting the lesion, and the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was recorded from the target. The PET/CT images were analyzed by at least two radiologists in a blinded manner. SUV was calculated according to the following formula: SUV?=?activity concentration in ROI (MBq/ml)/injection dose (MBq/kg body weight). The serial FDG and FMISO PET/CT scans were scheduled before treatment initiation and after two cycles of chemotherapy. PET/CT scans were performed at least 2 weeks after performing a diagnostic core biopsy and after infusion of drug. Serial examination using breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Details of the breast MRI have been described previously [15]. The device used was a 1.5-T instrument (Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) that used a body coil for transmission and a two-channel breast array coil for reception. For measuring maximum diameters of lesions, post-contrast coronal, axial, and sagittal images obtained by contrast-enhanced dynamic imaging were used. The percentage changes in tumor maximal size at baseline and after two cycles for lesions were assessed radiographically. Study end points The schedule of imaging studies using DOSI, MRI, FDG-PET/CT, and FMISO-PET/CT is shown in Figure 1. Early tumor metabolic response assessed by serial FDG-PET/CT has been widely accepted as predictive of clinicopathological outcome for advanced breast cancer in a neoadjuvant setting [16],[17]. An optimal cutoff value between 40% and 65% of the baseline SUV has been suggested for potential early identification of nonresponders. In this study, we employed a reduction rate of 40% as a cutoff value for FDG-SUV to separate responders from nonresponders (Figure 2A). 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.g002 Figure 2 Results of tumor shrinkage and hypoxia after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. A. Percentage change in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake expressed as standardized uptake value (%SUV) from baseline after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy regimen. Patients with %SUV >-40% were considered as responders and others were as nonresponders. B. Representative examples of transversal fused PET/CT scans at baseline and after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy with responders (No. 2) and nonresponders (No. 6) are shown. C. Percentage change in maximal size as measured by breast MRI at baseline and after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. Patient Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 were responders and Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were nonresponders. There were no significant difference between responders (mean ?24.9�26.4 SD) and nonresponders (mean 12.7�23.9 SD, p?=?0.1). D. Lesion maximal SUV (SUVmax) as measured by FMISO-PET/CT at the completion of the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. The intensity of SUVmax indicates hypoxic activity of the tumor. Nonresponders (mean 2.6�0.7 SD) had significantly higher FMISO-SUVmax than responders (mean 1.4�0.4 SD, p?=?0.03) Criteria for morphological response Patients underwent MRI tests to compare size reduction between baseline and the completion of treatment according to the RECIST guideline [18]. The protocol stipulated that the initial treatment should be discontinued in patients who showed progressive disease (PD) (20% or more increase in size) or appearance of new metastatic lesions and that such patients should be excluded from further participation in the study. Assessment of pathological response Pathological tumor response was determined on the basis of the General Rules of Criteria and Pathological Recording of Breast Cancer 2007 by at least two pathologists [19]. Surgical specimens were cut in 0.5-cm-thick slices and evaluated for the presence of microscopic tumor cells in the invasive area as well as areas with marked fibrosis or scarring, and the presence of ductal component and lymph nodal metastasis was not evaluated. No residual invasive cancer cells in all areas of the surgical specimens was defined as pathological complete response or pCR (grade 3). The disappearance or marked degeneration of two-thirds or more of the tumor cells was defined as substantially effective (grade 2). "
Breast_Cancer " The disappearance or marked degeneration of one-third to less than two-thirds was defined as moderately effective (grade 1b). The disappearance or marked degeneration of less than one-third of the tumor cells or mild tumor cell degeneration, regardless of the percentage, was defined as mildly effective (grade 1a). Almost no change in cancer cells after treatment was defined as not effective (grade 0). Statistics MedCalc software (Mariakerke, Belgium) was used to perform statistical evaluations. Continuous variables were presented as means, median, and standard deviations (SD). A paired Student's t-test was used to analyze changes in variables. Differences at a p value of less than 5% were considered to be statistically significant. Results Baseline characteristics We enrolled seven women in this study. All patients received at least two cycles of the regimen. One patient (No. 3) declined further treatment after the completion of two cycles and was therefore withdrawn from the study. Another patient (No. 6) discontinued the study treatment because of a paclitaxel-induced infusion reaction and then received further chemotherapy using nab-particle paclitaxel on a triweekly basis. All patients underwent DOSI, MRI, FDG-PET/CT, and FMISO-PET/CT imaging tests on treatment. The baseline characteristics of the seven patients are shown in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 52.6 years (range, 36�63 years), and the median tumor size was 51.7 mm (range, 30�67 mm) assessed by breast MRI. Based on breast MRI and FDG-PET/CT examination, five patients were determined to have TNM stage III and two patient had stage IV with lung and multiple bone metastases. One patient (No. 1) had previously received hormonal therapy, and the other six patients had not previously received systemic therapy. Five patients had histologically invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with luminal subtype, and two patients had IDC with triple-negative subtype. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.t001 Table 1 Patient demographics.

Assessment of therapeutic response Employing a reduction rate of 40% as a cutoff value for FDG-PET/CT metabolic response, tumors with reductions ?40% were defined as responders (n?=?4), and tumors with <40% reductions were defined as nonresponders (n?=?3) (Figure 2A and B). Figure 2C showed that the responders achieved remarkable tumor shrinkage (mean, ?24.9%�26.4 SD) and Figure 2D showed low levels of FMISO-SUV (mean, 1.4, �0.4 SD) at the completion of the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. On the other hand, the nonresponders showed no evidence of tumor shrinkage (mean, 12.7%�23.9 SD) but still sustained high levels of FMISO-SUV (mean, 2.6�0.7 SD) at the same time point. There was significant difference of FMISO-SUV level between responders and nonresponders (p?=?0.03). All nonresponding patients included PD on the basis of RECIST criteria and/or histopathologically no response (grade 0) following surgery. On the other hands, all responding patients included partial response (PR) and/or histopathologically marked or moderate response (grade 2 or grade 1b) (Table 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.t002 Table 2 Therapeutic outcome of patients after administration of the initial chemotherapy.

Assessment of hemodynamic biomarkers Figure 3A and B showed three dimensional reconstruction mapping of tHb and stO2 levels of tumor-bearing breast and contralateral normal breast. All patients had a hotspot corresponding to tumor lesion and significantly higher tHb of tumor-bearing breast (mean, 60.5 �M�38.5 SD) compared with that of contralateral normal breast (mean, 15.2 �M�5.1 SD, p?=?0.009). Responding tumors (mean, 37.2%�9.5 SD) had significantly lower level of tHb compared to nonresponding tumors (mean, 91.6%�42.1 SD, p?=?0.04). In contrast, for stO2 maps, there was no difference between tumor (mean, 67.3%�9.3 SD) and normal tissue (mean, 67.3%�5.1 SD, p?=?0.9). Responding tumors appeared an elevation of stO2 level corresponding to tumor lesion and surrounding normal tissue, while nonresponding tumors showed a dip of stO2 level compared to surrounding normal tissue. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.g003 Figure 3 Baseline maps of breast tHb and stO2. Three dimensional reconstruction mapping of baseline tHb (A) and stO2 (B) of tumor-bearing breast and contralateral normal breast. Tumor-bearing breast map shows a 6�6-cm measurement area that included the tumor located at the center and surrounding normal tissues at the margins. Contralateral normal breast map includes a 4�4-cm measurement area corresponding a mirror image location. Figures 4 present serial maps of the distribution of tHb (A) and stO2 (B) levels in tumor-bearing breasts of all the patients over the observed time window during treatment. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.g004 Figure 4 Serial maps of tumor-bearing breast tHb and stO2 on treatment. Serial maps of tumor-bearing breast tHb (A) and stO2 (B) during bevacizumab treatment at baseline (day ?1) and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the initiation of bevacizumab. The measurement points of stO2 were exactly identical to those of tHb during treatment. Figure 5A shows the change in the mean tumor tHb levels from baseline during treatment. The mean tumor tHb level at baseline (mean, 60.5 �M�38.5 SD) was compared with those at day 1 (mean, 49.6 �M�26.3 SD, p?=?0.5), day 3 (mean, 47.5 �M�32.3 SD, p?=?0.5), day 6 (mean, 54.6 �M�41.9 SD, p?=?0.7), day 8 (mean, 50.5 �M�30.9 SD, p?=?0.6), and day 13 (mean, 58.8 �M�40.7 SD, p?=?0.9). There were no significant difference of tumor tHb level between responders and nonresponders on each time point. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098715.g005 Figure 5 Results of serial monitoring of tumor tHb and stO2 during bevacizumab treatment. A. Percentage change in tumor tHb on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the initiation of bevacizumab relative to the baseline level. There were no significant difference of the value between responders and non-responders during the time points. B. The mean value of stO2 at baseline (Day ?1) and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the initiation of bevacizumab. The value of nonresponders was significantly lower than that of responders on day 1, day 3, and day 6 (p<0.05). Figure 5B shows the observed mean tumor stO2 percentage at baseline and during the treatment. The mean stO2 percentage at baseline did not differ between responders (mean, 70.9%�10.5 SD) and nonresponders (mean, 62.4%�5.4 SD, p?=?0.1), but the mean stO2 percentage was significantly higher in responding tumors at day 1 (mean, 71.1%�4.2 SD), day 3 (mean, 69.9%�9.6 SD), day 6 (mean, 71.6%�3.7SD) compared to nonresponding tumors at day 1 (mean, 58.7%�5.4 SD, p?=?0.02), day 3 (mean, 55.3%�6.0 SD, p?=?0.04), day 6 (mean, 58.7%�7.5 SD, p?=?0.03). There were no significant difference at day 8 and 13 between two groups. Discussion In this study, the breast cancer patients showed considerable variation in the early responses to single-agent bevacizumab. Our initial experience illustrates at least two patterns of tumor hemodynamics. When the patients were grouped into responders and nonresponders on the basis of the serial FDG-PET/CT results, both groups showed remarkably elevated tHb in lesions relative to the adjacent breast tissue tHb levels. Figure 5A shows that a transient decrease from the baseline tumor tHb level occurred in the responders and nonresponders during the first 1 weeks. This finding indicates that a decrease in tumor vascularity could not be a biomarker of substantially therapeutic response to bevacizumab but may be an indicator of other pharmacological effects of bevacizumab; for example, blockage of VEGF, which induces vasoconstriction [20]. Van der Veldt et al. reported that patients who received single-agent bevacizumab had a significant decrease in plasma levels of circulating VEGF at 3 h after bevacizumab administration and the majority of patients had a substantial recovery in VEGF level after 4 days [21]. This trend of circulating VEGF level is consistent with our results of early tHb response to bevacizumab. Figure 3B shows that the baseline stO2 values of nonresponding tumors (Nos. 5, 6 and 7) were lower than those of the surrounding normal breast tissues, and sequential maps of figure 4B showed that relatively low levels of tumor stO2 were sustained over the observation time window. In fact, these two patients had unfavorable pathological outcomes based on surgical findings and the other patient had progression of both primary and distant metastatic lesions after treatment. This result may indicate that severe chronic hypoxia was present at baseline with insufficient vascular remodeling and failure to normalize even after infusion of bevacizumab. On the other hand, the observed mean stO2 levels of figure 5B at different time points in responding tumors fluctuated depending on the patient, but they apparently trended higher than those of the adjacent normal tissues during the observation time window. For example, the No. 2 patient had a responding tumor that showed a gradual increase in stO2 on days 1 and 3 despite attenuation of tHb. This result may explain the effect of bevacizumab, which contributes to normalization of the tumor vasculature and enhances oxygenation. In fact, the No. 2 patient had a better pathological outcome with minimally invasive components at surgery. In the other patients defined as responders, the tumor stO2 levels also varied greatly in response to bevacizumab but remained high during the observation time window. However, these tumors substantially improved stO2 after paclitaxel and then achieved favorable pathological results. Thus, the concomitant change in tumor stO2 may indicate how efficiently tumor oxygenation has recovered following vascular remodeling due to VEGF blockage. In a retrospective study that examined 41 breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Ueda et al. reported that elevated baseline levels of tumor stO2 significantly correlated with pCR [22]. In addition, the investigators claimed that tumor reoxygenation exhibited by elevation of tumor O2Hb as early as day 1 after the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is called O2Hb flare, was adequate to discriminate nonresponding tumors from both partial and complete responders [8]. These findings were consistent with the current result that showed the significance of tumor oxygenation to improve chemotherapy response. In essence, vascular normalization is considered to occur only in regions of the tumor where the abnormal and immature vasculature of the tumor microenvironment has been corrected by proper dosing and timing of bevacizumab, which would result in sufficient oxygen delivery [23]. In other words, our experience suggests that if vascular remodeling fails, bevacizumab-induced vessel regression may cause more severe hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment. However, a limitation of this preliminary study is that the number of patients was too limited to confirm this speculation. A larger number of patients is needed to verify our findings and provide sufficient evidence to support our speculation concerning the possible effect of bevacizumab in patients with failure of vascular remodeling. In conclusion, this noninvasive optical imaging technique for visualizing vascularity and oxygenation could be useful for tracking the vascular normalization window. Although our findings are not definitive, the initial results suggest that a further study to identify a particular subset of patients who would benefit from bevacizumab may be beneficial.

All rights reserved. 2014 Purpose Given the relation between screening and improved cancer outcomes and the persistence of ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, we explored ethnic differences in colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and mammography screening in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Methods Logistic regression was applied to examine the influence of ethnicity as well as demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, family history of cancer, and previous screening history on self-reported screening participation collected in 1999�2002. Results The analysis included 140,398 participants who identified as white, African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, US born-Latino, or Mexican born-Latino. The screening prevalences overall were mammography: 88% of women, PSA: 45% of men, and colonoscopy: 35% of men and women. All minority groups reported 10�40% lower screening utilization than whites, but Mexican-born Latinos and Native Hawaiian were lowest. Men were nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.89�1.99) as women. A personal screening history, presence of comorbidities, and family history of cancer predicted higher screening utilization across modalities, but to different degrees across ethnic groups. Conclusions This study confirms previously reported sex differences in colorectal cancer screening and ethnic disparities in screening participation. The findings suggest it may be useful to include personal screening history and family history of cancer into counseling patients about screening participation.

We hypothesized addition of olaparib to carboplatin can be administered safely and yield preliminary clinical activity. Methods Eligible patients had measurable or evaluable disease, gBRCAm, and good end-organ function. A 3 + 3 dose escalation tested daily oral capsule olaparib (100 or 200mg every 12 hours; dose level1 or 2) with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) on day 8 (AUC3 day 8), then every 21 days. For dose levels 3 to 6, patients were given olaparib days 1 to 7 at 200 and 400 mg every 12 hours, with carboplatin AUC3 to 5 on day 1 or 2 every 21 days; a maximum of eight combination cycles were permitted, after which daily maintenance of olaparib 400mg every12 hours continued until progression. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined in the first two cycles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected for polymorphism analysis and polyADP-ribose incorporation. Paired tumor biopsies (before/after cycle 1) were obtained for biomarker proteomics and apoptosis endpoints. Results Forty-five women (37 OvCa/8 BrCa) were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached on the intermittent schedule. Expansion proceeded with olaparib 400mg every 12 hours on days 1 to 7/carboplatin AUC5. Grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia (42.2%), thrombocytopenia (20.0%), and anemia (15.6%). Responses included 1 complete response (1 BrCa; 23 months) and 21 partial responses (50.0%; 15 OvCa; 6 BrCa; median = 16 [4 to >45] in OvCa and 10 [6 to >40] months in BrCa). Proteomic analysis suggests high pretreatment pS209-eIF4E and FOXO3a correlated with duration of response (two-sided P < .001; Pearson�s R 2 = 0.94). Conclusions Olaparib capsules 400mg every 12 hours on days 1 to 7/carboplatin AUC5 is safe and has activity in gBRCAm BrCa/OvCa patients. Exploratory translational studies indicate pretreatment tissue FOXO3a expression may be predictive for response to therapy, requiring prospective validation. 2984705R 2786 Cancer Res Cancer Res.

Specifically, with this method, we are able to relate estimates of tumor growth rates and metastatic burden derived from a population level model to estimates of the primary tumor vascular response and the circulating tumor cell (CTC) fraction derived from a tissue level model. Variation in the population level model parameters produce differences in cancer-specific survival and cure fraction. Variation in the tissue level model parameters produces different primary tumor dynamics that subsequently lead to different growth dynamics of the CTCs. Our method to bridge the population and tissue scales was applied to lung and breast cancer separately, and the results were compared. The population model suggests that lung tumors grow faster and shed a significant number of lethal metastatic cells at small sizes, whereas breast tumors grow slower and do not significantly shed lethal metastatic cells until becoming larger. Although the tissue level model does not explicitly model the metastatic population, we are able to disengage the direct dependency of the metastatic burden on primary tumor growth by introducing the CTC population as an intermediary and assuming dependency. We calibrate the tissue level model to produce results consistent with the population model while also revealing a more dynamic relationship between the primary tumor and the CTCs. This leads to exponential tumor growth in lung and power law tumor growth in breast. We conclude that the vascular response of the primary tumor is a major player in the dynamics of both the primary tumor and the CTCs, and is significantly different in breast and lung cancer.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of 636 IMPC and 297?735 IDC cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database comparing disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) between IMPC and IDC. Results: A higher percentage of IMPC cases (52.0%) had nodal metastases compared with IDC cases (34.6%). The 5-year DSS and OS for IMPC was 91.8% and 82.9%, respectively compared with 88.6% and 80.5% for IDC, respectively. For both IMPC and IDC, oestrogen-receptor positivity was associated with better survival, while having four or more positive lymph nodes or larger tumour size correlated with worse survival. Radiotherapy provided a survival benefit for both histological types. Conclusions: Despite IMPC's higher propensity for lymph node metastasis, IMPC has DSS and OS that compare favourably with IDC. micropapillary carcinoma breast cancer ductal carcinoma prognostic factors survival histological special type radiotherapy 0217410 5045 J Nucl Med J.

Because the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in breast and ovarian carcinoma, as well as in other malignancies, HER2-specific Nanobodies may be valuable radiodiagnostics and therapeutics for these diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the tumor-targeting potential of anti-HER2 5F7GGC Nanobody after radioiodination with the residualizing agent N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl 3-125/131I-iodobenzoate (*I-SGMIB). Methods The 5F7GGC Nanobody was radiolabeled using *I-SGMIBand, for comparison, withN?-(3-*I-iodobenzoyl)-Lys5-N?-maleimido-Gly1-GEEEK (*I-IB-Mal-D-GEEEK), another residualizing agent, and by direct radioiodination using IODO-GEN (125I-Nanobody). The 3 labeled Nanobodies were evaluated in affinity measurements, and paired-label internalization assays were performed on HER2-expressing BT474M1 breast carcinoma cells and in paired-label tissue distribution measurements in mice bearing subcutaneous BT474M1 xenografts. Results *I-SGMIB-Nanobody was produced in 50.4% � 3.6% radiochemical yield and exhibited a dissociation constant of 1.5 � 0.5 nM. Internalization assays demonstrated that intracellular retention of radioactivity was up to 1.5-fold higher for *I-SGMIB-Nanobody than for coincubated 125I-Nanobody or *I-IB-Mal-D-GEEEK-Nanobody. Peak tumor uptake for *I-SGMIB-Nanobody was 24.50% � 9.89% injected dose/g at 2 h, 2- to 4-fold higher than observed with other labeling methods, and was reduced by 90% with trastuzumab blocking, confirming the HER2 specificity of localization. Moreover, normal-organ clearance was fastest for *I-SGMIB-Nanobody, such that tumor�to�normal-organ ratios greater than 50:1 were reached by 24 h in all tissues except lungs and kidneys, for which the values were 10.4 � 4.5 and 5.2 � 1.5, respectively. Conclusion Labeling anti-HER2 Nanobody 5F7GGC with *I-SGMIB yields a promising new conjugate for targeting HER2-expressing malignancies. Further research is needed to determine the potential utility of *I-SGMIB-5F7GGC labeled with 124I, 123I, and 131I for PET and SPECT imaging and for targeted radiotherapy, respectively.

The optimal frequency of intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate administration is unclear. We thus performed a study evaluating the effects of switching from 3�4 to 12 weekly therapy in patients with biochemically defined low-risk bone metastases. Patients with serum C-telopeptide (CTx) levels ?600 ng/L after ?3 months of 3�4 weekly IV pamidronate were switched to 12 weekly therapy for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients maintaining CTx levels in the lower-risk range. All endpoints (serum CTx and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), skeletal-related events (SREs) and self-reported pain) were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. Treatment failure was defined as biochemical failure (CTx > 600 ng/L) or a SRE. Exploratory biomarkers including; serum TGF-?, activin-A, bone sialoprotein (BSP), procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide and urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) were assessed at baseline as predictors for failure to complete treatment. Seventy-one patients accrued and 43 (61 %) completed 48 weeks of de-escalated therapy. Reasons for failure to complete treatment included; biochemical failure (CTx > 600 ng/L) (n = 10, 14.1 %), on-study SRE (n = 9, 12.7 %), disease progression (n = 7, 9.9 % including death from disease [n = 1, 1.4 %]) or patient choice (n = 2, 2.8 %). Elevated baseline levels of CTx, BSAP, NTx and BSP were associated with treatment failure. The majority of patients in this biochemically defined low-risk population could switch from 3�4 weekly to 12 weekly bisphosphonate therapy with no effect on CTx levels or SREs during the 48 week study. Larger trials are required to assess the roles of biomarkers as predictors of adequacy of de-escalated therapy. Keywords Bisphosphonate Breast cancer Bone metastasis Skeletal related event Biomarker De-escalated issue-copyright-statement � Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Background Bisphosphonates are administered every 3�4 weeks to patients with bone metastases from breast cancer, based on experience in treating hypercalcaemia of malignancy [1] as well as for convenience (coinciding with the timing of most chemotherapy regimens). However, this rationale ignores both the pharmacodynamics of bone-targeted agents which have activity in bone for many years [2] and the modest absolute magnitude of benefit from these therapies [3]. In addition, once started bone-targeted agents are rarely discontinued [4�6] and are usually given for longer than the 1�2 years evaluated in clinical trials [7�9]. As patients with metastases limited to the skeleton may have a prolonged disease course [5, 7, 10, 11], they will receive multiple doses of bisphosphonate [12]. This is important as adverse events such as renal toxicity [13], osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical fractures [14�16], are associated with both the potency and the cumulative administered dose [17]. Frequent therapy also has financial and quality of life implications for patients and health care providers [18]. A number of completed or ongoing trials [19�25] have evaluated the safety and efficacy of reduced dosing intervals of bisphosphonates. However, use of skeletal related events (SREs), defined as pathological fractures, radiotherapy/surgery to bone, spinal cord compression or hypercalcaemia as the primary study endpoint [19], requires a large sample size and extended follow up. Consequently, smaller studies have utilised biomarkers of bone resorption, such as, N- and C-telopeptides (NTx and CTx respectively) as surrogate markers of SRE risk [26�28]. In a small pilot randomised study comparing 3�4 weekly with 12 weekly pamidronate in patients with biochemically defined low-risk disease, we successfully demonstrated similar control of serum CTx between the two study arms with 72 % of patients maintaining control of CTx in the de-escalated arm [20]."
Breast_Cancer "Here, we report on a larger cohort of de-escalated (every 12 weeks) bisphosphonate therapy in patients with biochemically defined low-risk bone disease. It was hypothesized that de-escalated therapy will provide similar control of bone resorption for a period of 1 year in these lower risk patients. In addition, through the prospective collection of serum and urine samples, we evaluated if alternative biomarkers correlated with patient outcomes. Materials and methods Study population Women with breast cancer and radiologic, scintigraphic, and/or biopsy confirmed bone metastases who had received at least 3 months of 3�4 weekly IV pamidronate were enrolled. Eligible women needed to have evidence of lower-risk metastatic bone disease defined as baseline serum CTx < 600 ng/L. This threshold was selected based on data from large prospective datasets [26], demonstrating that it is indicative of the range between low and medium risk disease. Patients were to have had no change in systemic anti-cancer therapy or radiation therapy in the 28 days prior to signing consent [21]. The study was approved by the Ontario Cancer Research Ethics Board, Toronto, Canada. As part of the main study consent, patients could also optionally consent to the collection of urine and serum samples for future research. Trial design All study participants were switched from 3�4-weekly to 12 weekly pamidronate. Baseline levels of fasting serum CTx and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured. Serum CTx and BSAP were reassessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Data on self-reported pain using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [29], the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain (FACT-BP) [30], and the occurrence of SREs and analgesic use were also collected at these time points. All patients were advised to take calcium (1,200�1,500 mg/day) and vitamin D3 (800�1,000 IU/day) while on study. Endpoints The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients maintaining CTx levels within the low risk range (?600 ng/L) at 48 weeks. However, the primary endpoint was changed to the proportion of patients coming off study for any reason at 48 weeks. This was due to evidence that patients were being removed from treatment before 48 weeks due to SRE and withdrawals. The revised primary endpoint is therefore the most conservative result. Secondary endpoints included: frequency of SREs, change in serum BSAP and change in self-reported pain. Treatment failure was defined as either loss of biochemical control (defined as confirmed CTx levels >600 ng/L) or an on-study SRE. Due to CTx variability, if a patient had an elevation >600 ng/L at the predefined study time points, then a repeat measure was taken 4 weeks later. If CTx remained elevated, then that patient was considered a treatment failure. Some patients did not complete the study due to withdrawal, progressive disease, or death. Exploratory analyses assessing the utility of putative biomarkers of bone turnover or tumour progression as predictors of treatment failure were also conducted. Biomarkers of interest with previous evidence of a role in bone metastases included: serum-transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 [31, 32], activin A [33�36], procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) [37�39], bone sialoprotein (BSP) [40] and urinary NTx levels [41, 42]. Biochemical analysis Blood was drawn in the morning following an overnight fast and prior to pamidronate infusion. Samples were allowed to clot and were centrifuged at 4 �C for 10 min at 3,400 RPM. Serum was frozen at ?80 �C until analysis. Urine was collected as a second pass, fasting specimen and frozen at ?80 �C until analysis. Serum CTx was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay using CrossLaps� on an IDS iSYS automated analyzer. Analytical precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was 11.3 % at 210 ng/L and 6.4 % at 850 ug/L. Serum BSAP was measured by a chemiluminescence assay, Ostase�, on the Beckman Coulter Unicel DxI. The CV is 7.7 % at 10.0 ug/L and 7.5 % at 44.2 ug/L. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH were measured by a chemiluminescence assays, on the IDS iSYS or Beckman Coulter Unicel DxI, respectively. Alternative biomarkers were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) in baseline serum samples for TGF-?1 (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN, detection limit 20 pg/ml, interassay variability ~8.3 %), activin A (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN, detection limit 4 pg/ml, interassay variability ~5.9 %), P1NP (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan China, detection limit 15 pg/ml, interassay variability ~12 %), and BSP (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan China, detection limit 2 ng/ml, interassay variability ~12 %). Urine NTx levels were measured using the Osteomark assay (Alere, Scarborough ME, detection limit 2 nM BCE/mM creatinine, interassay variability 6.9 %). All samples were measured in duplicate and averaged values used. When values were below the threshold of detection for each respective assay, concentrations were assigned as 0.1 units below the sensitivity threshold for purposes of statistical analysis. Statistical analysis Sample size was determined by precision. Prior experience showed that 72 % of patients treated with 12 weekly pamidronate maintained their telopeptides in the low risk range over a 48 week period [20]. Assuming this, 61 patients were needed to estimate this proportion with 95 % confidence interval width of 20 % (i.e. �10 %). After accounting for 10 % drop-out, the required sample size was 68 patients. Patients who came off study for withdrawal, progressive disease or death were considered treatment failures for the primary analysis, but a supportive analysis was performed excluding these patients. For experimental biomarker analyses, exploratory statistical analysis was used to compare those eligible for biomarker analysis versus ineligible using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (continuous variables), Fisher�s exact tests (binary variables) or the Cochran-Armitage test for trend (ordinal variables). Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to explore for association between clinical factors and baseline biomarker levels. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate which factors were prognostic for completion of study therapy or having a SRE. Multivariable models were constructed using forward stepwise selection methods. All of the statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, and were two-sided with a p value of 0.05 or less being considered statistically significant. No corrections were made for multiple significance testing. Results Patient enrolment and baseline characteristics From October 2010 to September 2011, 84 patients were screened, with 71 eligible for enrolment (Fig. 1). Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients had bone metastases for a median of 15 months (range 3�106) and received IV bisphosphonates for a median of 14 months (range 3�106). Of enrolled patients, 17 (24 %) had a SRE prior to study entry. Thirty-one patients (47 %) had metastases confined to the skeleton, 29 (41 %) patients had received one prior line of palliative systemic therapy while 20 (28 %) had received two lines of systemic therapy at the time of study entry.Fig. 1CONSORT diagramTable 1Baseline characteristicsAll patientsEligible for exploratoryNot eligible for exploratory p value N 71638Duration of bone metastases (n = 70), monthsMedian (range)15 (3, 106)15 (3, 106)14 (9, 59)0.93PTHMedian (range)6.5 (1.6, 65)6.2 (1.6, 65)7.7 (3, 13)0.67Vitamin DMedian (range)93 (5, 203)93 (5, 203)90 (49, 138)0.49Months, taking Bisphosphonates prior to starting studyMedian (range)14 (3, 106)14 (3, 106)11 (4, 59)0.54Baseline CTxMedian (range)110 (25, 850)110 (25, 740)235 (25, 850)0.32Baseline BSAP (n = 70)Median (range)9.15 (4.9, 1190.0)9.05 (4.9, 46.4)13.85 (8.7, 1190.0)0.007FACT-BP subscaleMean (sd)48.7 (10.8)48.6 (10.6)49.5 (12.4)0.72BPI-severity (n = 70)Median (range)3 (0, 26)3 (0, 26)1 (0, 13)0.64BPI-interference (n = 69)Median (range)5 (0, 46)5 (0, 46)2.5 (0, 28)0.54Total number of prior lines of systemic therapy for metastatic disease123456729 (40.9)20 (28.2)10 (14.1)4 (5.6)3 (4.2)3 (4.2)2 (2.8)25 (39.7)17 (27.0)10 (15.9)4 (6.4)3 (4.8)2 (3.2)2 (3.2)4 (50.0)3 (37.5)0 (0.0)0 (0.0)0 (0.0)1 (12.5)0 (0.0)0.59b Total number of SRE prior to study entry0123454 (76.1)12 (16.9)3 (4.2)1 (1.4)1 (1.4)47 (74.6)12 (19.1)2 (3.2)1 (1.6)1 (1.6)7 (87.5)0 (0.0)1 (12.5)0 (0.0)0 (0.0)0.67a NTx (n = 63)Median (range)186.1 (43.3, 1918.1)186.1 (43.3, 1918.1)Not measured�P1NP (n = 63)Median (range)33940 (3087, 124933)33940 (3087, 124933)Not measured�BSP (n = 63)Median (range)43.8 (1.99, 290.4)43.8 (1.99, 290.4)Not measured�TGF-?

Median baseline BSAP was 9.15 ug/L (range 4.9�1,190 ug/L, Table 1). There was a statistically significant difference in the median baseline BSAP levels for patients eligible for exploratory analysis versus those that were not, with patients not eligible for exploratory study having higher median BSAP levels (Table 1, p = 0.007). Pain scores Pain at study entry was assessed using two independent scoring methods, FACT-BP and BPI (assessed as BPI-severity and BPI-interference). In all cases, pain assessment scores were reflective of low to moderate pain, indicative of the low-risk patient population enrolled in this study (Table 1). In all cases, no significant difference was noted in baseline pain scores between those patients eligible for exploratory analysis and those that were not (Table 1). Primary analysis Of the 71 patients enrolled, 43 (61%, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 48�72 %) completed 48 weeks of de-escalated therapy. Twenty-eight patients did not complete 1 year of de-escalated therapy; 10 patients (14.1 %) came off study due to biochemical failure (CTx >600 ng/L), 9 (12.7 %) due to the development of a SRE, 6 patients (8.5 %) were withdrawn from study by their physician due to disease progression, and 1 patient (1.4 %) due to death from breast cancer. An additional 2 patients (2.8 %) did not complete one year of de-escalated therapy due to withdrawal of consent. We did not observe any bisphosphonate-specific toxicities such as renal impairment, ONJ or atrial fibrillation. Frequency of SREs As mentioned, 9 (12.7 %) patients who maintained CTx <600 ng/L experienced on study SREs. In addition, of the 10 patients who came off study early due to elevated CTx, 4 of these patients subsequently developed a SRE. Thus, out of the 71 patients enrolled, a total of 13 (17 %) had a SRE within 1 year of study entry. In contrast, of the 8 screened patients who had signed consent but were ineligible for study entry due to baseline CTx >600 ng/L, 6 (75 %) had a SRE within the year even though they remained on 3�4 weekly bisphosphonate treatment. Of the 9 patients who withdrew from the study due to progression, death or patient�s choice, 1 had a SRE within 1 year. This patient was taken off study by her oncologist due to disease progression, and her CTx was subsequently found to be >600 ng/L. Exploratory analyses of additional putative biomarkers Of the 71 enrolled patients, 63 (89 %) consented to use of bio-specimens for exploratory biomarker analyses (urine NTx, was available from 62 of these 63 patients). Median levels were: NTx 186 nM BCE/mM creatinine (range 43�1,918); P1NP 34 pg/mL (range 3�125); BSP 44 ng/mL (range 2�290); TGF-? 17 pg/mL (range 5�29); and activin A 399 pg/mL (range 187�5,904) (Table 1). Association between biomarkers and clinical factors Table 2 shows the Spearman correlation coefficient (?) estimate measuring association between select clinical factors and baseline biomarkers. Baseline CTx and BSAP had only weak to no association with any of the clinical factors measured. Of the exploratory baseline biomarkers measured, only baseline BSP and TGF-? showed a moderate association with duration of bone metastases (Table 2, ? = 0.36 and ? = ?0.40, respectively), while no associations were noted between any of the other clinical factors of interest.Table 2Association of clinical factors with baseline biomarker measurementsVitamin DScreening CTxBaseline CTxBSAPNTxP1NPBSPTGF-?Activin AWeight?0.11?0.060.150.09?0.000.20?0.170.28?0.07Height?0.13?0.02?0.02?0.06?0.05?0.110.04?0.230.01BSA?0.13?0.050.120.05?0.020.15?0.110.16?0.03Duration of bone mets0.170.100.040.130.00?0.07 0.36 ?0.40 0.17PTH?0.260.00?0.01?0.050.15?0.13?0.06?0.02?0.02FACT-BP subscale0.05?0.00?0.140.14?0.06?0.12?0.250.00?0.12BPI-severity0.09?0.22?0.06?0.22?0.130.190.030.12?0.02BPI-interference0.03?0.130.06?0.140.010.270.170.03?0.05Vitamin D�?0.06?0.19?0.05?0.110.02?0.07?0.090.09Spearman correlation coefficient (?) was used to identify associations between biomarkers and clinical factors.

(highlighted in bold above) Prognostic factors for completion of 1 year of de-escalated therapy Baseline vitamin D, NTx, BSP and CTx were all statistically significant for completion of therapy (Table 3). Patients with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.03�1.39), lower CTx (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.93�0.99), lower NTx (OR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.42�0.92) and lower BSP (OR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.77�0.95) were all more likely to complete therapy. In multivariable analysis, vitamin D, NTx and BSP remained associated with likelihood of completion of therapy.Table 3Prognostic factors of completion of therapy N Odds ratio (95 % CI) p valueUnivariate analyses Weight711.00 (0.96, 1.04)0.93 Height710.96 (0.89, 1.04)0.30 BSA710.78 (0.05, 12.51)0.86 Duration of bone metastases701.00 (0.98, 1.03)0.84 PTH710.95 (0.89, 1.02)0.17 Vitamin D (/10 units)711.20 (1.03, 1.39)0.017 FACT-BP Subscale711.01 (0.96, 1.05)0.82 Baseline CTx (/10 units)710.96 (0.93, 0.99)0.007 BSAP700.88 (0.77, 1.01)0.066 NTx (/100 units)630.62 (0.42, 0.92)0.017 P1NP (/1,000 units)630.99 (0.97, 1.01)0.41 BSP (/10 units)630.86 (0.77, 0.95)0.003 TGF-?631.04 (0.95, 1.14)0.43 Activin A (/100 units)630.96 (0.91, 1.02)0.19 BPI-severity701.00 (0.92, 1.09)0.93 BPI-interference691.02 (0.97, 1.06)0.44 Metastatic disease (bone only vs bone plus other)651.51 (0.56, 4.06)0.41Multivariate analyses BSP (/10 units)630.82 (0.72, 0.93)0.003 NTx (/100 units)630.62 (0.39, 0.97)0.035 Vitamin D (/10 units)631.27 (1.04, 1.54)0.017In univariate analyses, vitamin D, CTx, NTx and BSP were all statistically significant for completion of therapy.

BPI-severity score was the only factor statistically significant in the univariate or multivariate analyses Discussion Increasing interest in de-escalated bone-targeted therapies has been driven by concerns around the balance between intravenous bisphosphonate benefit and harm rather than trying to deliver the optimal frequency of drug based on individual patients� needs [3]. De-escalating bone-targeted therapy in low-risk patients has clear advantages for both the patients (less visits to the centre for treatment, and possibly less toxicity), and the health care system (both through direct and indirect costs) provided that de-escalation is not associated with a worsening of patient outcomes. Surveys have shown that the concept of de-escalation of therapy is acceptable to both oncologists [6] and patients with bone metastases [43]. There is significant heterogeneity in current de-escalation trials in terms of eligibility criteria, bisphosphonate used (mostly zoledronic acid) and duration of intravenous bisphosphonate therapy prior to study entry (ranging from bisphosphonate na�ve [22], ?3 months [20], to 9�12 [18] months of prior monthly therapy). Interpretation of study findings is further confounded by the different outcomes measured. While some use SREs as the primary endpoint, others have used biomarkers of bone turnover such as NTx [22] and CTx [20] as surrogates of SRE risk. Thus, even with the publication of the ZOOM trial [18] the findings of a recent systematic review would suggest that clinical equipoise still exists [44]. Although biomarker-driven studies have advantages, they should only be used for planning larger definitive studies [6]. Our current data also questions their use as prognostic markers of SRE risk. In patients deemed �low-risk�, the most commonly used markers, namely CTx, NTx, BSAP and P1NP were not significantly different between patients who experienced versus those that did not experience on study SREs. Of the 71 patients who entered the study, 61 % completed 48 weeks of de-escalated therapy, 14.1 % came off study early due to elevation of CTx >600 ng/L and 12.7 % due to on-study SRE. These results are within the 95 % CI of our previous study, where 72 % of patients treated with 12-weekly pamidronate maintained their telopeptides in the low risk range. This suggests that serum CTx <600 ng/L after ?3 months of IV bisphosphonate therapy may identify a patient population at particularly low risk of subsequent SREs, and hence identify likely candidates for more routine use of de-escalated therapy [20]. Low baseline CTx levels were associated with completing study in univariate analysis, which is not surprising given that rises in CTx above 600 ng/L was a mandated reason to come off study. However, baseline CTx levels in this low-risk cohort did not correlate with the occurrence of an on study SRE. This is likely due to the small sample size in our present study. The inability of CTx to prognosticate for SRE occurrence led us to evaluate other exploratory biomarkers at baseline to determine whether any of these could be useful for assisting in determining SRE risk in patients with CTx levels <600 ng/L. In addition to bone turnover markers frequently used in other studies (i.e. uNTx and P1NP), we also examined the levels of TGF-?, activin A and BSP. TGF-? plays a critical role in osteolytic metastatic disease [45], and correlates with breast cancer stage and bone metastasis [31, 32]. Recent studies have also implicated activin A in metastatic and osteoclastic processes [33�35], and plasma levels of activin A are higher in breast cancer patients with bone metastases as compared to those without, and positively correlate with bone metastatic burden [36]. Tumour-derived expression of BSP is also correlated with development of osseous metastases [40]. Unfortunately, none of the standard (CTx, BSAP, NTx or P1NP) nor additional experimental biomarkers (TGF-?, activin A or BSP) showed any significant association with SRE incidence in these low-risk patients at baseline. However, among the experimental biomarkers, it should be noted that baseline levels of BSP were moderately associated with duration of bone metastases, and were also associated with failure to complete the study despite the fact that BSP did not reach statistical significance for an association with incidence of on-study SRE. Of all the baseline parameters measured, only baseline pain scores as measured by BPI-severity was prognostic for increased risk of SRE. This finding highlights the utility in using pain score assessment tools in these types of studies. Our study has several limitations, including: use of a biomarker surrogate for defining a population at low risk of SREs, a relatively small sample size, the variable duration of prior 3�4 weekly IV bisphosphonate use and the use of pamidronate rather than more potent bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid. Given our current findings regarding the lack of association between CTx and SRE incidence in this low risk cohort, other biomarkers including pain measurement should be considered in these low risk cohorts in future studies addressing use of de-escalated regimens of bone-targeting agents. Other potential indicators of bisphosphonate efficacy such as control of circulating tumour cells or levels of ?? T-cells should also be further investigated as the recent literature suggests a potential role in efficacy of bisphosphonates [46�49]. Our trial and experimental biomarker findings are also limited by the fact that a small number of clinical events have occurred within the 48-week follow-up of the study. These findings also have important implications for the design of future studies addressing these issues in low risk populations, and suggest that to determine treatment effects on SRE risk, longer durations of follow-up are required to perform statistically powered analysis with sufficient numbers of events. However, it remains possible that changes in biomarker levels over time may provide better assessment of parameters such as SRE risk. In conclusion, reducing the frequency of IV bisphosphonate administration could be of benefit to both patients and the health care system provided it is not associated with worse patient outcomes. In the current study we have shown that the majority of patients with a baseline serum CTx level <600 ng/L after at least 3 months of IV pamidronate have a low risk of SREs with 1 year of de-escalated therapy. However, no association between CTx levels and on-study SREs was observed in this low risk cohort, highlighting the need for identification of markers that are prognostic for SREs. Of all the measured baseline parameters, only pain as measured by BPI severity scores was associated with on-study SREs, hence our data suggest that pain measures may be a promising candidate marker of SRE risk in these low-risk patients. The results of our present study along with our previous pilot randomised study [20] and ZOOM [18] suggest that de-escalated 12 weekly bisphosphonate treatment will likely become increasingly used after a limited period of 3�4 weekly treatment. However, there is a need for completion and analysis of larger more definitive trials, including those with denosumab, to ensure the safety of this strategy. Christina L. Addison and Nathaniel Bouganim contributed equally to this project. "
Breast_Cancer "Background Given the estimate that 30% of our genes are controlled by microRNAs, it is essential that we understand the precise relationship between microRNAs and their targets. OncomiRs are microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been frequently shown to be deregulated in cancer. However, although several oncomiRs have been identified and characterized, there is as yet no comprehensive compilation of this data which has rendered it underutilized by cancer biologists. There is therefore an unmet need in generating bioinformatic platforms to speed the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Description We describe here OncomiRdbB, a comprehensive database of oncomiRs mined from different existing databases for mouse and humans along with novel oncomiRs that we have validated in human breast cancer samples. The database also lists their respective predicted targets, identified using miRanda, along with their IDs, sequences, chromosome location and detailed description. This database facilitates querying by search strings including microRNA name, sequence, accession number, target genes and organisms. The microRNA networks and their hubs with respective targets at 3'UTR, 5'UTR and exons of different pathway genes were also deciphered using the 'R' algorithm. Conclusion OncomiRdbB is a comprehensive and integrated database of oncomiRs and their targets in breast cancer with multiple query options which will help enhance both understanding of the biology of breast cancer and the development of new and innovative microRNA based diagnostic tools and targets of therapeutic significance. OncomiRdbB is freely available for download through the URL link http://tdb.ccmb.res.in/OncomiRdbB/index.htm. MicroRNAs Breast cancer Targets 3'UTR miRanda TLDA Background Although microRNAs were discovered two decades ago, their importance as an abundant class of regulatory non-coding RNAs came to light only after their rediscovery by Reinhart et al., in 2000 [1]. To date, thousands of miRNAs have been identified across a range of human diseases and have been shown to be deregulated in the majority of cancers [2]. Identifying the signatures of oncomiRs in human cancer samples is extremely difficult due to the paucity of sample material. Also, cloning of these microRNAs has proven difficult due to their extremely small size and complexity of spatial and temporal expression patterns. However, the precursor transcripts of ~70-80 nt with a characteristic stem-loop fold back structure from which the miRNAs are derived, are conserved and this typical structure of precursor-microRNAs enables its identification through computational tools. Finding the targets of a given miRNA is as important as identifying the miRNA itself to know the gene(s) it controls hence infer possible biological function through either negative or positive regulation of the target gene(s) [3]. Computational prediction of target genes for miRNAs in animals is a challenging task for both experimental and computational groups, due to the complexity in miRNA target recognition [4]. Eventhough perfect complementarity in miRNA-mRNA sequences is not required for target recognition and interaction, a small region in the 5?end (termed the seed region �position 2-8�) of miRNA is apparently needed for a near perfect base-pairing with its 3?UTR to inhibit the translation of mRNA [5]. Several databases of miRNAs, based on sequence annotation and miRNA genomics such as miRBase, [6] miRNAMap2.0 [7], miRGen [8], miRGator v2.0 [9], miRecords [10] have been developed. Amongst these databases, miRBase serves as a central database of mature miRNA sequences. MicroCosm, PhenomiR 2.0 [11] and mir2Disease [12] provide data pertinent to various diseases, whilst TargetScan [13], PicTar [14] and TargetMiner [15] are databases based on algorithms designed for microRNA target prediction for the complementary base-pairing in the seed region of the targets. TarBase [16] is a resource of experimentally validated microRNA targets, while RNAhybrid [17] is a resource based on calculation and hybridization between miRNA and mRNA. Recently, S-MED database has been created [18], which gives details of oncomiR expression profiles in sarcomas. However, there is currently no comprehensive oncomiR database for breast cancer that will provide an overview of microRNAs, their targets and the pathways that are regulated by them during breast cancer development. Our aim was to develop a database compiling all oncomiRs and their target genes involved in breast cancer and validate them using human breast cancer samples. The known oncomiRs responsible for breast cancer in two mammalian genomes, human and mouse were obtained from different databases including MicroCosm, PhenomiR and mir2Disease. The target genes were taken from the signaling pathways that are known to be affected during breast cancer. By using the miRanda algorithm [19], target genes were predicted for both human and mouse. Prediction programs including PicTar and TargetScan were used as additional sources. In nutshell, OncomiRdbB comprises of 782 human microRNAs and 246 murine microRNAs, along with 711 and 490 targets for both genomes respectively. It also provides the precise target location within the 3?UTR, 5?UTR or exon regions of the target genes. A proportion of the microRNAs have also been validated in breast cancer tissues using Taqman Low Density Arrays (TLDA). Amongst these, 34 microRNAs have not previously been reported to be associated with human breast cancer in any database. Hence, this is the first report of these novel microRNAs associated with breast cancer. Finally, using the �R� algorithm and �GeneGo MetaCore� (http://www.genego.com) we have characterized some of these microRNAs and their target interactions, generating examples of delineated networks and hubs of microRNA-target interaction. We envisage these network analyses will further support the identification of oncogenic targets of therapeutic value. Construction Mining of microRNAs and finding their targets MicroRNAs of both human and mouse genomes were retrieved from different databases including miRBase, PhenomiR 2.0 and miR2Disease. A Perl subroutine was written to automate the retrieval and filtering of miRBase sequences. In order to find out the targets of these microRNAs, genes of various key signaling pathways including Wnt, JAKSTAT, Notch, Apoptosis, VEGF and MAPK were downloaded from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) miRBase (MicroCosm), Cancer Gene Expression Data Base (CGED) [20]. The 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exon sequences of these genes were then extracted from the Ensembl database in FASTA format using the BioMart tool. miRanda was used at 3 different energy levels (EL-15,-20 and ?25) to predict putative targets for the miRNAs involved in breast cancer at the 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exonic regions of the genes of the different pathways. The parameters used for the search were at the cutoff score of 120. The miRanda software was initially designed to predict miRNA target genes in Drosophila. It is similar to the alignment proposed by Smith and Waterman [21], where scores were based on sequence complementarity and not on sequence identity. These targets were further confirmed using the TargetScan and PicTar algorithms. Experimental validation using Taqman Low Density Arrays Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) was performed with 50 individual human samples followed by confirmation with LNA arrays. Reverse Transcription reaction was carried out using TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) followed by PCR Reaction. Real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7900- TLDA Real-Time PCR System. Each TaqMan Assay was run in quadruplicate. All the samples displayed good RIN value, linearity (R2?>?0.96), good abundance (average CT range 22�28) and NTC CT >38. MicroRNA profiling was done using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays, which contains 667 human microRNAs covering Sanger miRBase version10. A pre amplification step of cDNA with preamp megaplex pool primers was performed to enhance the ability to detect miRNAs with low expression. The TaqMan human microRNA arrays consisted of 2 plates: pool A and pool B. RNU 46 and RNU 48 were used as endogenous controls and are included for data normalization. One TaqMan microRNA Assay, not related to human, was also included as a negative control. The set enabled accurate quantification of 667 human microRNAs. Reverse transcription followed by PCR reactions were carried out in ABI 7900 HT. The results were analysed using spotfire (statminer) software and the data was normalized using RNU 46 & RNU 48 as endogenous controls. Fold changes were represented as log 10 2 - ? ? CT. Pathway analysis of miRNA-Target Functional enrichment analysis of microRNAs and their target genes was performed to identify unique, similar and common sets of genes/proteins. Enrichment analysis of miRNAs and their targets in oncogenic signaling pathways was performed using the GeneGo MetaCore software. This software is a web-based program and performs functional analysis of experimental data or computationally compiled datasets on ontologies such as GeneGo process networks, GeneGo diseases, disease biomarkers, gene ontology processes (GO) metabolic processes, various signaling pathways, canonical pathways, protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions etc. This enrichment analysis creates a degree of relevance of the datasets to the GeneGo MetaCore suite, defined by p-values where lower p-values were assigned higher priorities. The statistical enrichment analysis of miRNAs and their targets were performed based on the p-values generated. We have used ClustalX to identify sequence similarity with a conserved biological function of miRNAs in breast cancer. �R� algorithm �R� is an open source statistical language for statistical analysis and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, matrix manipulation and clustering). In this study R (v2.14) packages (ggplot2) [22] were used for building the network of miRNA and their target genes. To build-up the miRNA-target interaction network we constructed a matrix using the binary concept 0 & 1. As an example, hits between microRNAs and specific target genes were assigned a binary value of 1, while 0 implies absence of recognition. This matrix was uploaded in �R� which generated a graphical miRNA-target interaction network. The �R� program was used to generate such types of network where a single miRNA was hitting several targets or where several miRNAs hit single target in each oncogenic signaling pathway. Contents miRNAs responsible for breast cancer The mined miRNAs were classified as breast cancer miRNAs based on their complementarity to the target genes of different oncogenic pathways (MicroCosm) deregulated in breast cancer. This was further confirmed using miRanda, TargetScan and PicTar (Figure 1). A comparison between OncomiRdbB and existing databases demonstrated the utility of integrating various databases into one comprehensive database (Figure 2). A phylogenetic functional relationship between microRNAs of human and mouse was established by aligning the sequences using ClustalX. A conserved biological function of breast cancer microRNAs between mice and human genomes was observed after clustering both data sets. In the cladogram, branches from the same node represent descendents of a similar ancestor or cluster of the same family indicating their origin from a common ancestor. For example, hsa-miR-145, miR-151-3p and miR-30 families align with their mmu-miR counterparts indicating a conserved biological function in breast cancer development in both the genomes (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We retrieved a total of 782 human and 246 mouse microRNAs and their respective sequences associated with breast cancer from existing miRNA databases including miRBase, miR2Disease and PhenomiR. We have validated these miRNAs with two different platforms, Taqman low density arrays consisting of 667 human microRNAs (version 10) and LNA arrays using human breast cancer samples of grade 2 and grade 3 each consisting of Stages I to III. Approximately 400 significant and valid miRNAs lighted up in one or the other grades/stages classifying them as breast cancer microRNAs. Figure 1 Schematic illustration of construction of OncomirdbB using different bioinformatics approaches. MicroRNAs were mined from different databases like miRbase, PhenomiR2.0 and miR2Disease. In order to find targets for these miRNAs, different pathway genes were downloaded from KEGG database and removed the repeated entries by using Perl script. We used miRanda for finding the targets at different energy levels. Figure 2 Comparison of human and mouse miRNAs from different databases with oncomiRdbB. Human and mouse miRNAs were mined from various databases listed and compiled as OncomiRdbB. This database has a maximum number of miRNAs compared to MicroCosm, PhenomiR and miR2Disease which list 460, 322 and 83 human miRNAs and 183, 63 and 0 mouse microRNAs respectively. Identification of novel microRNAs using Taqman Low Density Arrays and LNA microarray Among the 400 significant miRNAs validated experimentally using 2 array platforms, a set of 34 novel miRNAs was identified as novel breast cancer miRNAs since they were not classified as breast cancer miRNAs earlier. The targets of these miRNAs were also identified using miRanda at 3 energy levels, EL-15, -20 and ?25 and the most stringent ones (EL ?25) are listed in Table 1. These miRNAs and their targets were implicated in various signaling pathways, as revealed by the MetaCore software (Figure 3a and Table 1). The network of interactions showed involvement of key oncogenic signaling pathways like Wnt, JAK-STAT, PI3K and AKT. A spectrum of miRNAs including miR-337-5p, miR-17-1, miR-15a, miR-491-5p, miR-339, miR-337-3p, miR-241, miR-19a were predicted to down regulate oncogenic targets like TGF?, BCLXW, BCL-Xl, STATs, c-MYC and SMAD (as represented by red lines). It was also observed that miR-141 positively controls the canonical pathway involving SP1 transcription factor via TGF?, receptor, which activates matrix metalloproteinases, the deregulation of which plays a crucial role in metastasis.

Enrichment analysis of miRNAs and their targets shows the list of different signaling networks they are involved and are deregulated in different carcinomas. miRNA targets The miRanda program was used to predict microRNA targets in the various oncogenic signaling pathways. This algorithm was run at energy level EL-15 and 711 genes in human and 490 in mice were identified. The stringency level was increased by decreasing the energy levels to EL-20 and EL-25, in order to increase the accuracy and to identify fewer targets with increased specificity (Figure 4a). By computing the ratio of miRNA targets with the total number of genes in the respective pathways, the percentage cooperation among different pathways including the Notch, VEGF, Wnt, MAPK, Apoptotic and JAK-STAT pathways was deciphered and thus their potential involvement in breast cancer development. Notch signaling pathway was found to have the highest (~50%) percentage of cooperativity between the novel miRNAs and their signaling molecules compared to other pathways analyzed in both murine and human hosts (Figure 4b). Figure 4 MiRNA target identification at various energy levels in different pathways. a. Target identification of microRNAs at 3 different energy levels was performed on the retrieved sequences from different oncogenic signaling pathways using miRanda. b. shows the percentage cooperation of different microRNA targets of these pathways involved in the development of breast cancer. We next characterized microRNA target locations within the genes and found that almost 70% of miRNAs target the 3?UTR, 10% of them target the 5?UTR and another 10% were found to target the exons. 5% of miRNAs targeted exons at their 3? and 5? UTR, respectively within the gene and the remaining 5% targeted 5?UTR, 3?UTR & exons (Figure 5a). There were many mRNAs which were targeted by multiple miRNAs and among such targets, the Dvl3 gene in the wnt pathway was chosen as an example for further analysis. Interestingly, a number of microRNAs were found to target this gene at its 3?UTR, 5?UTR, exons, or both 3?UTR & 5?UTR or both 3?UTR & exons. The microRNAs targeting the 3?UTR of Dvl3 showed a phylogenetic relationship when their sequences were aligned using ClustalX (Figure 5b). Regulation of Dvl3 by these sets of microRNAs was also deciphered using GeneGo MetaCore (Figure 5c). On the other hand, single miRNAs hitting multiple targets at various genomic locations such as 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exons were also identified. One example, miR-let-7b, had multiple targets at all positions as shown schematically in Figure 5d. Those microRNAs targeting exons and 5?UTR were seen to target key regulators of oncogenic signaling pathways (Additional file 2: Figure S2). The interaction between such microRNAs and their targets in various signaling pathways were delineated using GeneGo MetaCore. The microRNA-target networks and hubs and their therapeutic targets were also deciphered (Figure 3a and Additional file 3: Figure S3a and b).

Generation of pathway maps using enrichment analysis Enrichment analysis was performed for the predicted microRNAs and their targets to further support their involvement in breast cancer development in both human and mouse using GeneGo MetaCore. This analysis statistically enriched the miRNAs and their targets with the available dataset in GeneGo MetaCore and generated p-values where high negative log p-values of microRNAs and their targets reflected significant association with breast oncogenesis. The enrichment analysis also supported our percentage co-operative analysis of different oncogenic pathways in breast cancer development and progression (Figure 3b and c). Similarly, further enrichment analysis for relative expression of these novel miRNAs in different disease conditions in humans showed the highest score for immunoproliferative disorders followed by lymphoproliferative disorders (Figure 3d). The spectrum of miRNAs was found to be crucial in GM-CSF signaling as depicted by the pathway maps generated using MetaCore software (Figure 3e). OncomiRdbB database structure OncomiRdbB is fully designed and developed as a web interface where Perl-CGI is used to connect the Apache web server which works as a back-end to generate dynamically user friendly HTML front end queries, an open-source graphics system that compiles into java code. OncomiRdbB provides easy search options for users to retrieve meaningful information of oncomiRs of two different genomes, their mature sequences, accession no, their respective targets in different oncogenic pathways, location in chromosome and their respective genes. Users can search query by name, accession no, target gene and sequence of miRNAs. It also facilitates downloading of specific microRNAs along with their target details or the complete list of microRNAs and their target information depending on the query. It provides useful interaction data for these microRNAs and their targets in various signaling pathways at the 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exons. Finally this database also provides links to the parental biological databases from which the information is retrieved. OncomiRdbB is hosted on the web and is freely accessible to those who wish to retrieve the information compiled in this database. Utility and discussion MicroRNAs are involved in the regulation of important signaling pathways by controlling the expression of a variety of oncoproteins which are responsible for cancer development and progression [23]. A few existing databases listed these microRNAs and their association with many diseases, including different cancers from diverse organisms as described above. However, none of these specifically describe the class of oncomiRs and their targets for a given cancer. Due to the lack of a properly compiled database, these data remain under utilized. Therefore, we present here a database, OncomiRdbB (OncomiR database for Breast cancer), which contains all the mined and compiled information along with ~400 validated oncomiRs of breast cancer. We also report additional novel oncomiRs experimentally identified in human cancer samples, along with their specific target genes. Compared to miRBase, PhenomiR and miR2Disease, OncomiRdbB collates significantly more microRNAs and their targets in both human and mouse. Thus OnmiRdbB provides better compiled information regarding the oncomiRs involved in breast cancer. MicroRNAs with oncogenic or tumor-suppressive function are capable of modulating several targets in multiple genetic pathways. Mouse models are the predominant mammalian platform chosen to model cancer and as such they represent ideal platform to study the microRNA cancer association in human and to validate targets [24]. With this premise, we performed sequence alignment using ClustalX in order to find any evolutionary relationships which would suggest functional similarity between these miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs of human and mouse formed tight phylogenetic clusters. Comparative cluster analysis additionally confirmed that these miRNAs have common biological functionality and possess similar mechanisms of action in breast cancer. This analysis also interrogated any conserved functional relationships in the development of breast cancer. For example, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-151-3p and hsa-miR-30 showed sequence and functional similarity with mmu-miR-145, mmu-miR-151-3p and mmu-miR-30 respectively. MicroRNA target identification is an important step in determining its specific roles in regulating a cellular process. MicroRNAs are known to regulate mRNAs post-transcriptionally by binding at the 3? UTR. However, miRNA target prediction in animals is still in its infancy due to limited knowledge about parameters involved in the interaction between miRNAs and their target. Also, the uneven distribution of miRNA binding locations within the target transcript poses a further challenge to the sensitivity and efficiency of computational prediction [25]. Therefore, finding a consistent microRNA target across different miRNA target prediction tools is a challenging task [26]. In this study we used miRanda at different energy levels and PicTar and TargetScan algorithms to minimize the false positive rates during miRNA target prediction. Apart from the complementarity between the mRNA and miRNA, the miRanda algorithm also takes into account the weighted sum of match and mismatch scores for base pairs and gap penalties, allowing one wobbling pair in the seed region. Thus, use of this algorithm takes into consideration different characteristics of the miRNA-mRNA interaction [27]. The miRanda program predicted �perfect� pairing of miRNA-mRNA at lower energy (EL-25) levels, while not �so-perfect� pairing at higher energy levels (EL-15). Thus, miRNA-target prediction at different energy levels will help users to identify putative targets of all miRNAs and also aid validation of specific breast cancer targets in both genomes. In OncomiRdbB, a total of 711 human and 490 mouse targets are listed which is high compared to the targets listed in other databases. One of the additional features of OncomiRdbB is that these targets are also classified based on various oncogenic signaling pathways which is not yet available in other databases. McCubrey et al., [28] have shown that there is interaction among Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/PI3K/PTEN and Akt pathways during carcinogenesis. Likewise, cooperative interaction of Notch and Ras/MAPK pathway in human breast carcinogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis was demonstrated by Fan et al., [29]. Therefore, the percentage cooperative analysis was carried out to address the role of miRNAs in deregulating multiple oncogenic pathway genes in breast cancer development along with the percentage of target hits by the miRNAs among the total number of targets present in each pathway. Around 30�50 percent target hits in Notch, VEGF, Wnt, Apoptosis, MAPKinase and JAK-STAT pathways indicated a significant intervention by oncomiRs in these pathways during breast cancer development. Although the exact percentage cooperative analysis has not been demonstrated, it is evident that these miRNAs are deregulating various oncogenic pathways. The information generated also led to the identification of candidate microRNAs regulating multiple therapeutic targets to combat breast cancer effectively. Although the majority of miRNAs have been reported to target the 3?UTR, Zhou et al., [30] identified miRNAs targeting coding region and 5? UTR, but these were less represented and less effective in translation repression. Inhan et al., [31] showed that while most of the miRNAs interact with 3?UTR of the target genes with its 5?end, a small proportion of miRNAs binding to 5?UTR use the 3?end for effective interaction. Hence, in order to define the interacting locations of miRNAs within the target genes, 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exon sequences were downloaded and used for target location identification. This analysis indicated that majority (around 70%) lie in the 3?UTR, whilst 10% miRNAs target the 5?UTR, 10% targeted exons, 5% of miRNAs targeted exons at their 3? and 5? UTR respectively within the gene and the remaining 5% targeted 5?UTR, 3?UTR & exons. Interaction between miRNAs and their targets was analyzed using the �R� algorithm. Through this statistical analysis program, it was observed that either multiple targets are being controlled by a single miRNA or that several miRNAs target single transcripts. Nevertheless, the former situation was found to be a more common phenomenon than the latter. Dvl3 is one example of a target gene where several miRNAs act at the 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exons. A phylogenetic clustering of the 3?UTR miRNAs indicated a conserved functional relationship amongst them. On the other hand, we observed that a single miRNA, let-7b, hit multiple targets of several oncogenic pathways at their 3?UTR, 5?UTR and exons. It was also observed that targets with location in 5?UTR and exons were the key players of oncogenic pathways. The interaction of miRNAs and their respective targets was deciphered using the GeneGo MetaCore software suite to identify miRNAs with multiple potential targets for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer. The interactive networks and hubs revealed functional co operativity of several miRNAs and target groups in the various signaling pathways. Engels et al., [32] also demonstrated that several miRNAs bind at 3?UTR targets and inhibit translation via co-operative actions [33]. Our analysis also corroborated with this and revealed the possibility of using multiple targets for possible therapeutic intervention. To the best of our knowledge, information on the cooperative interaction of miRNAs and their targets is a unique feature of OncomiRdbB. To support the authenticity of our database as specific to breast cancer, we have performed enrichment analyses of miRNAs and their targets from different oncogenic signaling pathways and provided the degree of relevance of miRNAs and their targets based on p-values, where lower p-values were assigned higher priority (GeneGo MetaCore software). These p-values indicated the probability of a given number of miRNAs and target genes matching with a certain number of miRNAs and target genes responsible for given disease and signaling pathways available in the GeneGo MetaCore suite. The target enrichment analysis supported our hypothesis that there is co-operation among different oncogenic pathways during cancer progression and it also indicated the extent of their potential involvement in cancer progression. This further suggested that our miRNA database for human and mouse could be an acceptable methodology for probing breast cancer miRNAs interrelationships. We have experimentally validated our database by 2 different array platforms using human breast cancer samples. Approximately 400 miRNAs were valid and significant in one or the other stage/grade. In addition to these, this approach identified 34 novel miRNAs which are not yet reported as breast cancer miRNAs in any of the databases so far. The target identification of these novel miRNAs using miRanda algorithm at 3 energy levels together revealed 162 gene targets. The interaction between the novel miRNAs and their respective targets using MetaCore software delineated the networks and the hubs involved in various oncogenic signaling pathways. Anti-apoptotic molecules such as BCLXW, BCL-Xl were found to be down regulated by the novel miRNAs identified in this study (as predicted by GeneGo pathway), indicating possible roles of these miRNAs in development of cancer and metastatic progression. For example, miR-337-5p, miR-17-1, miR-15a, miR-491-5p, miR-339, miR-337-3p, miR-241, miR-19a were found to modulate oncogenic targets including TGF?, STATs, c-MYC and SMAD. Taken together, this established a clear mechanistic interaction underlying miRNA deregulation and tumorigenesis. Our data also indicated potential functional cooperativity of miRNAs and their targets in the development of breast cancer [34]. Hence our finding of cooperation among pathways was supported by the GeneGo MetaCore pathway interaction enrichment analysis. Moreover, we have also deciphered various potential therapeutic targets and their networks. More recently, it has been shown that circulating miRNAs are potential biomarkers for the detection and subsequent staging and grading of breast cancer [35,36]. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the miRNA expression between cancerous and normal tissue samples from patients showed major differences in miRNA expression. This study provides a basis for the blood-borne testing of miRNAs as biomarkers for the detection and subsequent staging of breast cancer. Thus, the in silico cum experimental validation data regarding the novel miRNA generated using OncomiRdbB could be used for future miRNA-based biomarkers and/or targeted therapeutics. Conclusions OncomiRdbB is designed as a comprehensive user friendly database which lists miRNAs and their respective targets for breast cancer in both the human and mouse. We have experimentally validated ~400 miRNAs in human breast cancer tissues and found 34 miRNAs which are as yet unreported. Users can retrieve information using miRNA name, sequence, accession no., gene name, organism or simply cancer type. OncomiRdbB gives details about the target genes, their chromosome location and position of the miRNA hits within the gene from various oncogenic signaling pathways. This is the first attempt to delineate the complicated interaction network involving different miRNAs and their targets in five oncogenic signaling pathways for breast cancer. OncomiRdbB is a central resource for cancer biologists and clinicians for further experimental validation of these targets and will also help clinicians in the selection of potential candidates for the development of novel clinical biomarkers and ultimately novel therapeutic interventions.

The nonadherence rate to hormonal treatment is reported to be as high as 60%. The goal of this study was to evaluate the factors evoked by the patients as well as the demographic and disease-related factors that could be associated with nonadherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy. Methods All consecutive patients treated for an estrogen receptor�positive breast cancer who showed up for regular follow-up with a single breast specialist between November 2008 and April 2009 were included in the study. We assessed adherence to hormonal therapy (either with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor). Reasons for adherence and nonadherence were collected. Records were also reviewed for demographic and cancer characteristics and for treatment components. Results We included 161 patients in the study; 150 (93.2%) adhered to hormonal treatment. Side effects and absence of conviction were the main reasons for nonadherence. The importance of the diagnosis of cancer, fear of recurrence and regular follow-up were reported as the main reasons for adherence. Conclusion Severity of disease and side effects are associated with nonadherence to treatment. Strict follow-up appears to be a necessary adjunct in the adherence to treatment."
Breast_Cancer "Background Febrile neutropenia (FN) is common in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Risk factors for FN have been reported, but risk models that include genetic variability have yet to be described. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of patient-related, chemotherapy-related, and genetic risk factors. Methods Data from consecutive breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with 4�6 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or three cycles of FEC and docetaxel were retrospectively recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to assess risk of FN during FEC chemotherapy cycles. Results Overall, 166 (16.7%) out of 994 patients developed FN. Significant risk factors for FN in any cycle and the first cycle were lower platelet count (OR?=?0.78 [0.65; 0.93]) and haemoglobin (OR?=?0.81 [0.67; 0.98]) and homozygous carriers of the rs4148350 variant T-allele (OR?=?6.7 [1.04; 43.17]) in MRP1. Other significant factors for FN in any cycle were higher alanine aminotransferase (OR?=?1.02 [1.01; 1.03]), carriers of the rs246221 variant C-allele (OR?=?2.0 [1.03; 3.86]) in MRP1 and the rs351855 variant C-allele (OR?=?2.48 [1.13; 5.44]) in FGFR4. Lower height (OR?=?0.62 [0.41; 0.92]) increased risk of FN in the first cycle. Conclusions Both established clinical risk factors and genetic factors predicted FN in breast cancer patients. Prediction was improved by adding genetic information but overall remained limited. Internal validity was satisfactory. Further independent validation is required to confirm these findings. Multivariable analysis Febrile neutropenia Breast neoplasms Chemotherapy Genetics Single nucleotide polymorphism Background Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and febrile neutropenia (FN) are serious and frequent complications in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, and they result in hospitalisations [1-3] and chemotherapy dose reductions or delays that impact on treatment outcome and short-term mortality [4]. Adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy has an FN risk of between 9% and 14% (low-intermediate risk) [5]. Antibacterial or antifungal prophylaxis has recently been recommended for neutropenic patients expected to have a prolonged low neutrophil count or with other risk factors that favour complications [6]. Prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) in patients at high risk of FN (>20%) is recommended in international guidelines [5,7,8]. For chemotherapy regimens with an intermediate FN risk (10-20%), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) GCSF guideline recommends that patient risk factors should also be considered to determine individual risk of FN [5] and the likely benefit of prophylactic GCSF. Therefore, it is important to identify patients at high risk of FN before the initiation of chemotherapy to provide them with appropriate prophylactic measures. Risk models for the occurrence of CIN [9] and FN [10] in patients with breast cancer have been published. The risk factors identified include older age, lower weight, higher planned dose of chemotherapy, higher number of planned chemotherapy cycles, vascular comorbidity, lower baseline white blood cell count (WBC), lower platelet and neutrophil count, and higher baseline bilirubin. Prior chemotherapy, abnormal liver or renal function, low WBC, higher chemotherapy intensity, and planned delivery were identified as risk factors for neutropenic complications in a prospective US study of patients with different types of cancer [11]. Poor performance status and low lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were risk factors in a European study of solid tumour patients [12], as were tumour stage and number of comorbidities in elderly patients with solid tumours [13]. These risk models of CIN or FN that included patient- or chemotherapy-related factors were reported to be predictive. However, more refined models are necessary to achieve satisfactory performance in independent patient populations that include existing and emerging types of data, including stable genetic factors that are easily measurable, objective, and potentially independent from the inherent viabilities of clinical decision-making. Several studies have assessed the impact of genetic factors on haematological toxicity, but these studies were small in size or limited to only a few candidate genetic factors [14-16]. The objective of this study was to develop risk models for the occurrence of FN in breast cancer patients receiving FEC chemotherapy in any cycle and the first cycle based on a large set of patient-related, chemotherapy-related, and genetic characteristics. Methods Study population We retrospectively studied early (i.e., no distant metastases; Stage I-IIIC) breast cancer patients treated between 2000 and 2010 at the Leuven Multidisciplinary Breast Cancer Center of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. Consecutive patients were included if they received either three cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant combination chemotherapy consisting of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel or four to six cycles of FEC. Patient-related factors (genetics and tumour characteristics) and chemotherapy-related factors were retrospectively recorded in a clinical database. Haematological toxicities included were: FN (defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)?<?0.5 � 109/L and a body temperature???38�C according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America), prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (? 5 days), deep neutropenia (< 100/?l), grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3/4 anaemia during FEC chemotherapy cycles. Haematological toxicities that occurred during chemotherapy cycles with docetaxel were not included in the model. Grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicities were also recorded (toxicity grade based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 [17]). During most of the study period, only primary prevention with GCSF was reimbursed and, therefore, only used in selected patients aged 65 or over. Similarly, secondary use of GCSF was only reimbursed and used if patients had FN in the previous cycle or if deep neutropenia occurred for at least five days (although the latter was not systematically measured during the study period). The study design and full analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have previously been described in detail [18]; however, in the previous analysis the association of SNPs with FN was only adjusted for age, growth factor use, BMI, and planned cycles of chemotherapy. Only those SNPs that have been reported to be associated with haematological toxicity or to play a role in the metabolism of FEC chemotherapy were included in the current study. Logistic regression was performed to describe the association of SNPs with haematological toxicity, adjusted for known predictors of FN risk such as age, growth factor use, and planned number of cycles of chemotherapy. The ethics committee of the University Hospitals Leuven approved the study and all patients included in the study had given written informed consent for collection of genetic samples and for further analyses using this material and associated data. Endpoints and predictor variables The primary endpoint of the study was FN in any cycle, and FN occurring in the first cycle (cycle 1) was the secondary endpoint. The following variables were considered as predictors of FN: planned doses of fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FC, 600 mg/m2 until August 2004 and 500 mg/m2 after this date; epirubicin 100 mg/m2), age at diagnosis, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), chemotherapy setting (i.e. adjuvant or neoadjuvant), use of GCSF (information only available on primary or secondary use), planned cycles of FEC chemotherapy, selected SNPs [18], baseline WBC, ANC and platelet count, and other baseline laboratory parameters such as haemoglobin, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine. Although timing and reasoning of GCSF use were incomplete, its potential impact on the variables included in the final model was assessed for exploratory analysis. Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using Stata/SE version 12.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). All statistical tests were carried out two-sided at a 5% significance level and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. Descriptive and univariable analysis Binary and categorical data were summarised using frequencies and percentages. Continuous data were reported using means and standard deviations. In the univariable analysis of SNPs, the impact of multiple testing was assessed by separately calculating the false discovery rate (FDR) for each endpoint [19]. Associations between the endpoints and binary or categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared test or Fisher�s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables and their associations with the endpoints were assessed using univariable logistic regression analysis. Variables were further assessed in multivariable logistic regression analysis if a trend was seen in the univariable analysis (p???0.25), as recommended [20]. Linear correlations between potential predictors were assessed by calculating Pearson�s correlation coefficient and monotonic correlations were assessed using Spearman�s rank correlation coefficient. Variables were regarded as being dependent if the correlation coefficient was???0.7 or the correlation p-value was???0.05. Multivariable analysis Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the joint explanatory value of the candidate variables identified in univariable analysis; variables were included in the final multivariable models if their corresponding p-value was???0.05. Where simultaneous inclusion of dependent variables led to estimation problems (collinearity issues), the variable that explained more of the variability present in the endpoint was finally used. As patient-related and chemotherapy-related factors were already established as risk factors in several previous risk models, these variables were entered into the model first, ordered according to the p-value obtained in univariable analysis. SNPs were subsequently added. Interactions between variables were assessed. Model fit was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow [21] goodness-of-fit test. Test characteristics such as specificity (proportion of negatives correctly identified as not having an event), sensitivity (proportion of positives correctly identified as having an event), positive predictive value (PPV, proportion of patients identified to have an event who had an event) and negative predictive value (NPV, proportion of patients identified not to have an event who did not have an event) were obtained. The predictive ability of the final models was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC; sensitivity over 1-specificity) curve. To test the internal validity of the final models, nonparametric bootstrapping was performed [22]. Bootstrap estimates of the 95% CIs of the multivariable models were obtained by resampling the data 200 times. The obtained 95% CI estimates of the bootstrap resampling were compared to the 95% CIs calculated by the multivariable logistic regression model. Results Characteristics of the study group Of 1,012 patients that received FEC chemotherapy between 2000 and 2010, 18 patients were excluded due to receiving chemotherapy prior to FEC, which may have impacted on FN risk. The majority of 994 eligible patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (n?=?874, 88.0%); the remainder received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Most patients received three cycles of combination chemotherapy with FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel (n?=?507, 51.0%) or six cycles of FEC (n?=?405, 40.7%) (Table 1). The most common type of breast cancer was invasive ductal carcinoma (n?=?823, 82.8%) and patients mostly had grade 2 (n?=?334, 34.1%) or grade 3 (n?=?606, 61.9%) tumours. FN occurred in any cycle in 166 (16.7%) patients, of which 107 (10.8%) had FN in the first cycle of FEC chemotherapy. The most common haematological toxicity was prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (n?=?345, 34.7%). Other haematological toxicities such as grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and severe bleeding, and grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicities such as diarrhoea, mucositis, and neuropathy were rare (n?<?10, <1%). Primary prophylactic GCSF (before a CIN or FN event occurred) was given to 15 (1.5%) patients and the majority received no GCSF (n?=?654, 65.8%).

For rs246221, homozygous carriers of the T-allele variant had a lower risk of FN than carriers with at least one C-allele (FN risk of 13% versus 20% or 24%). Patients with the TT genotype of rs351855 were protected against FN compared to patients carrying at least one C-allele (FN risk of 10% versus 19% or 16%).

The area under the ROC curve was 0.661 (CI 0.629-0.691), as shown in Figure 1a: a value of 1 would denote perfect discrimination and 0.5 discrimination no better than chance. Overall, 864 of 910 patients (84.0%) were correctly classified by the logistic regression model at a predicted probability cut-off of 0.5; six out of 150 having FN and 758 out of 760 not having FN. Sensitivity was very low (4.0%) compared to specificity (99.7%). NPV and PPV were similar; the proportion of patients correctly identified not to have FN was 84.0% and the proportion of patients correctly identified to have FN was 75.0%. When the optimal cut-off of the model was used (i.e., predicted probability of 0.1609, where sensitivity and specificity were almost identical at 61.3%), the model correctly classified 61.2% of the patients and PPV and NPV were 23.8% and 88.9%, respectively. Internal validity of the FN in any cycle model was satisfactory; the 95% CIs of the bootstrap resampling were similar to the 95% CIs calculated by the multivariable logistic regression model.

ROC, receiver operating characteristic. *bysecting line indicates a predictiove ability that is no better than chance (ROC = 0.5). Risk factors of febrile neutropenia in cycle 1 Lower platelet count, haemoglobin at baseline, and lower patient height were significantly associated with a higher risk of FN in cycle 1 (Table 4). The SNP found to be significantly associated with FN in cycle 1 was rs4148350 in MRP1. For rs4148350, homozygous carriers of the T-allele had a higher risk of FN in cycle 1 than carriers of the homozygous or heterozygous G-allele (FN risk of 40% versus 10% or 18%). We found a statistically significant interaction between haemoglobin and height that increased the protective effect of higher haemoglobin and increased height but did not affect the other main effects of the model. The area under the ROC curve was 0.664 (CI 0.633-0.694), as presented in Figure 1b. At a probability cut-off of 0.5, one out of 98 patients was correctly classified having FN in cycle 1 and all 839 patients without FN in cycle 1 were correctly classified not having FN (overall, 89.7% correct classifications). Sensitivity was very low (1.0%); specificity was 100%, PPV was 100%, and NPV was 89.6%. At the optimal probability cut-off for the model (0.1041), 61.5% of the patients were correctly classified, sensitivity and specificity were 61%, PPV was 15.7%, and NPV was 93.1%. The 95% CIs of the bootstrap resampling were similar to the 95% CIs calculated by the multivariable logistic regression model, which supports the internal validity of the FN in the first cycle model. Discussion In this population of early breast cancer patients seen in routine clinical practice at a tertiary referral centre, we identified a set of genetic factors, in addition to patient-related and chemotherapy-related factors, that predict occurrence of FN in any cycle or the first cycle of chemotherapy. Significant predictors of a higher risk of FN in any cycle and in cycle one were: lower baseline platelet count, lower baseline haemoglobin, and carriers of the rs4148350 T-allele variant in MRP1, especially homozygous T-allele carriers. Patients with lower ALT and homozygous carriers of the rs246221 variant T-allele in MRP1 and rs351855 variant T-allele in FGFR4 had a lower risk of FN occurrence. Although the predictive ability of the models was improved by including genetic factors, the overall predictive ability remained poor. Genetic effects were stable and FN occurrence was very high in patients with specific SNP allele variants. The observed effects of lower baseline platelet count and haemoglobin are consistent with previous reports. Baseline platelet count has been shown to differ between cancer patients with mild and severe haematological toxicity [16], and low haemoglobin has been mentioned as possible risk factor for FN [27] and survival [28]. In the model of FN occurrence in any cycle, higher baseline ALT was significantly associated with FN but not baseline bilirubin [9,29]. Both measures are indicators of liver function and since the liver detoxifies drugs like epirubicin [30], impaired liver function may be an important risk factor for FN occurrence in patients receiving chemotherapy with epirubicin. A predictive role for WBC or ANC in CIN and FN occurrence in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy has been described in other studies [9-12], but could not be confirmed in our models. Most SNPs previously associated with FN occurrence [18] and reported to be involved in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity [31-33] were confirmed in the multivariable analysis. The SNP rs45511401 was not included in the multivariable regression model as it was highly correlated with rs4148350, and the latter variant explained the model variability slightly better. There were no correlations between SNPs included in the final model and patient- or chemotherapy-related factors. International guidelines [5,7,8] and the literature [9,12] report age, planned dose intensity, and planned number of chemotherapy cycles to be important risk factors for CIN and FN during chemotherapy. These risk factors could not be confirmed in our models. Patient-specific approaches to clinical management were not recorded in detail in this study and might therefore have masked the effect of age on FN occurrence. In addition, the exact cycle of FN occurrence was not available after the first cycle. Factors previously reported to protect against CIN and FN in any cycle of chemotherapy, such as dose reductions, dose delays, or growth factor use before an event occurred, could not be investigated since the details, reasons, and timing information were not available and only 15 out of 994 patients received primary prophylaxis with GCSF, mainly due to reimbursement criteria. The apparent predictive ability, i.e., the predictive ability assessed in the �training� dataset used to develop the models, was lower than in previously published models of CIN or FN occurrence in other cancers [9,11,34]. In these models, sensitivity and specificity at the optimal predicted probability cut-off was about 70% or higher, but in this study it remained below 70%. As commonly seen in models of FN occurrence, the NPV (? 90%) was much higher than the PPV because FN incidence is often around 20%; this implies an NPV of around 80% for simply assuming that FN does not occur in any patient. The areas under the ROC curves were relatively low but significantly higher than 0.5, the value indicating no predictive ability. In other words, the models allowed partial discrimination of patients at low or high risk of FN. Including genetic risk factors improved the models but absolute predictive ability remained rather low. The effects of the SNPs were stable and FN occurrence was very high in patients with specific, sometimes rare, SNP allele variants. In terms of clinical implications, genetic testing might help to identify a small proportion of patients at very high risk of FN who can be targeted with prophylactic measures. For the majority of patients, the current models do not reliably identify patients that will develop FN, but they do delineate patients who are unlikely to develop FN. This is clinically relevant since patients at low risk of FN probably do not need primary GCSF prophylaxis or nadir assessment, while the high-risk group is unpredictable and might need more extensive preventive measures or follow-up. The performance of any model tends to be highest in the training dataset. The results obtained with bootstrap resampling supported the internal validity of the FN in any cycle and the FN in first cycle models. The predictive ability of the models has yet to be tested in an entirely independent population, where model performance is usually lower. Before risk models are put to clinical use, true external validation is essential [35,36]. Another limitation of this study is the retrospective design; no detailed information was available on patient management in clinical practice, which is known to influence the risk of FN occurrence, and the reasons and timing of dose reductions and dose delays were not available. FN occurrence was not assessed according to chemotherapy cycle beyond the first cycle. GCSF was only administered to 15 patients before an event occurred due to stringent reimbursement criteria. Hence, the impact of GCSF on FN occurrence was difficult to assess. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of risk of FN in the first and any cycle of chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer that combined a set of patient- and chemotherapy-related factors with a large set of SNPs. Further validation studies are needed to confirm our findings, which should ideally be prospectively designed, sufficiently powered, and measure all possible predictors of FN occurrence reported in the literature. Approaches to clinical management that are measurable and known to influence the risk of FN occurrence, such as dose modifications or growth factor use before an FN event occurred, should be included. Information on SNPs should be available for as many patients as possible and the frequencies of possible genotypes of one SNP should be similar. Validated genetic factors have the potential to become reliable predictors of FN occurrence. The specific SNPs that were assessed in this study are independent from clinical decision-making and therefore less likely to be confounded by clinical practice. Conclusions We have identified a set of chemotherapy-related, patient-related, and genetic risk factors that predict occurrence of FN in the first and any cycle of chemotherapy in a large cohort of early breast cancer patients. Genetic effects in the models improved the predictive ability, but the overall predictive ability of the models remained poor. FN occurrence was very high in patients with specific SNP allele variants. Up-front genetic testing might be helpful to identify a limited group of very high-risk patients. Further independent validation is required to develop risk models that include genetic predictors of FN occurrence and can be used to personalise care.

Breast_Cancer "We have therefore designed 19-substituted BQAs to prevent glutathione conjugation and nonspecific interactions with protein thiols to minimize off-target effects and reduce hepatotoxicity. 19-Phenyl� and 19-methyl�substituted versions of geldanamycin and its derivatives, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), did not react with glutathione, whereas marked reactivity was observed using parent BQAs. Importantly, although 17-DMAG induced cell death in primary and cultured mouse hepatocytes, 19-phenyl and 19-methyl DMAG showed reduced toxicity, validating the overall approach. Furthermore, our data suggest that arylation reactions, rather than redox cycling, are a major mechanism contributing to BQA hepatotoxicity. 19-Phenyl BQAs inhibited purified Hsp90 in a NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)�dependent manner, demonstrating increased efficacy of the hydroquinone ansamycin relative to its parent quinone. Molecular modeling supported increased stability of the hydroquinone form of 19-phenyl-DMAG in the active site of human Hsp90. In human breast cancer cells, 19-phenyl BQAs induced growth inhibition also dependent upon metabolism via NQO1 with decreased expression of client proteins and compensatory induction of Hsp70. These data demonstrate that 19-substituted BQAs are unreactive with thiols, display reduced hepatotoxicity, and retain Hsp90 and growth-inhibitory activity in human breast cancer cells, although with diminished potency relative to parent BQAs.

Beta-naphthoflavone (BNF, DB06732) is an agonist of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and a putative chemotherapeutic agent that has antitumor activity against mammary carcinomas in vivo. However, the mechanism by which BNF exerts this antitumor effect remains unclear. Thus, we explored mechanisms of BNF�s antitumor effects in human breast cancer cells. This study showed that BNF suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase with downregulation of cyclin D1/D3 and CDK4 and upregulation of p21Cip1/Waf1, leading to a senescence-like phenotype in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, but not in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, BNF inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294,002, exhibited the same inhibitory effects on cyclinD1/D3, CDK4 and the cell cycle as BNF. Interestingly, BNF activated mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK) signaling, and more notably, MEK inhibitor PD98059 significantly blocked the BNF-induced cell cycle arrest and upregulation of p21Cip1/Waf1. Furthermore, specific ER? and AhR siRNA studies indicate that ER? is required in BNF-induced p21Cip1/Waf1 expression, and BNF-mediated cell cycle arrest and modulation of AKT and ERK signaling is AhR-dependent. Taken together, AhR-dependent inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, activation of MAPK/ERK and modulation of ER? is a novel mechanism underlying BNF-mediated antitumor effects in breast cancer, which may represent a promising strategy to be exploited in future clinical trials.

Patients with newly diagnosed, early stage estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer often show disease free survival in excess of five years following surgery and systemic adjuvant therapy. An important question is whether diagnostic tumor tissue from the primary lesion offers an accurate molecular portrait of the cancer post recurrence and thus may be used for predictive diagnostic purposes for patients with relapsed, metastatic disease. As the class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in ER+ breast cancer and has been linked to acquired resistance to hormonal therapy, we hypothesized pathway status could evolve over time and treatment. Biomarker analyses were conducted on matched, asynchronous primary and metastatic tumors from 77 patients with ER+ breast cancer. We examined whether PIK3CA and AKT1 alterations or PTEN and Ki67 levels showed differences between primary and metastatic samples. We also sought to look more broadly at gene expression markers reflective of proliferation, molecular subtype, and key receptors and signaling pathways using an mRNA analysis platform developed on the Fluidigm BioMark� microfluidics system to measure the relative expression of 90 breast cancer related genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Application of this panel of biomarker assays to matched tumor pairs showed a high concordance between primary and metastatic tissue, with generally few changes in mutation status, proliferative markers, or gene expression between matched samples. The collection of assays described here has been optimized for FFPE tissue and may have utility in exploratory analyses to identify patient subsets responsive to targeted therapies. This study was funded by Genentech Inc. The funders were responsible for the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, and preparation of the manuscript. Introduction Clinical management of breast cancer is currently based on diagnostic evaluation of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2. Such analyses are typically conducted on primary tumor tissue collected at the time of diagnosis, although many patients will survive for years without local or distant disease recurrence. Moreover, a variety of studies have shown discordance in ER status between primary and metastatic samples ranging from 10 to 40% [1], [2], [3]. This has sometimes been taken to reflect a true switch in biology of the tumor in response to therapy, but has also been attributed to sampling error in focally-receptor positive disease and limited accuracy and reproducibility of the assays for receptor expression [3]. Given that novel targeted therapies are being developed in ER+ breast cancer, changes in the biology of the tumor that occur during adjuvant therapy could adversely impact predictive value of diagnostic assessments conducted on primary tumor samples but used to guide therapy in metastatic patients. In particular, the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway has been linked in a variety of studies to acquired resistance to endocrine therapies both preclinically and clinically [4], and recent clinical results have validated this idea by showing that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane extends survival in patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy [5]. Upregulation or mutational activation of this pathway during adjuvant or front-line metastatic therapy could confound interpretation of predictive biomarkers conducted on primary tumor samples. To address the question of whether primary and metastatic ER+ breast cancer samples are generally similar in terms of biomarker prevalence, and hence whether primary tissue is an accurate indicator of biomarker status in later stage patients, we evaluated a panel of asynchronously collected matched primary and metastatic tumors with a panel of biomarkers related to proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal biology and PI3K pathway signaling. Previous studies have found that such tissues are generally concordant for PIK3CA and PTEN status [6], [7]. In addition, gene expression profiling of eight matched primary and metastatic breast cancer samples of mixed subtype has shown that gene expression profiles of primary breast tumors are generally maintained in distant metastases [8]. Here we extend these findings by showing in a large collection of ER+ breast tumors that gene expression profiles, as well as proliferation status, remain remarkably similar despite intervening time and treatment with both hormonal and chemotherapy regimens. Specifically the proliferation marker Ki67 showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76 between matched primary and metastatic samples, PIK3CA, AKT1 and PTEN status were all at least 90% concordant, and only six out of 90 genes showed a statistically significant difference in mRNA expression between primary versus metastatic tissue. Thus, archival primary tumor tissue provides a surprisingly accurate portrait of biomarker status in patients with disease recurrence. The collection of assays described in this manuscript has been extensively optimized and validated for low quantity, fixed archival tissue, suggesting it may provide a useful paradigm for generating exploratory biomarker data that can be used to understand therapeutic response and resistance in the context of clinical trials. Materials and Methods Tumor specimens and cell lines Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks were obtained for 77 patients with paired asynchronously collected matched primary and metastatic tumors. Tissue samples were obtained from Cureline, Inc (South San Francisco, CA) following approval of the Ethics Committee of Saint Petersburg City Clinical Oncology Hospital and appropriate confirmation of written informed consent. Tissue samples were also obtained from The MT Group (Van Nuys, CA) following IRB approval (http://www.sterlingirb.com). The IRB waived the need for written informed consent per FDA guidelines, as this was a retrospective study with anonymized patient data. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) sections were prepared for all samples and were reviewed by a pathologist to confirm diagnosis and assess tumor content. ER, PR and HER2 status was determined by local testing. Breast cancer cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) or from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Cell lines were archived at an early passage in the Genentech cell bank and authenticated either by a multiplex short tandem repeat assay or as previously described [9], [10]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) PTEN IHC was conducted on FFPE tumor samples using the Discovery XT automated staining platform (Ventana, Tucson, AZ). Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with Cell Conditioning I (CC1, Ventana). The primary antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (clone 138G6, Danvers, MA). Reactions were developed using the UltraMap DAB detection system (Ventana), and counterstained with Hematoxylin II (Ventana). PTEN was scored in a semiquantitative fashion by a single pathologist using an H-score method to account for heterogeneity of expression. The percentage of tumor cells present at each of four staining intensities was scored, and the H-score was calculated as follows: H ?=? (3 � % of strongly stained cells) + (2 � % of moderately stained cells) + (1 � % of weakly stained cells) + (0 � % of cells without staining). This gave a score ranging from total absence of PTEN in the tumor compartment (H-score 0) to PTEN expression in tumor cells equivalent to surrounding normal and stromal cells (H-score 300). Ki67 IHC was conducted on FFPE tumor samples using the Leica Bond-III automated slide stainer (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The primary antibody was obtained from NeoMarkers/LabVision (clone SP6, Fremont, CA). Reactions were developed using the Vectastain Elite ABC- Peroxidase detection system (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and counterstained with Mayer�s Hematoxylin. The percentage of tumor cells demonstrating nuclear expression of Ki67 was assessed by a single pathologist. DNA and RNA isolation from FFPE tumor tissue Five slides of FFPE tumor sections per sample were macrodissected to enrich for neoplastic tissue, as identified by pathologist assessment. The slides were then deparaffinized using three five minute incubations in Envirene followed by a three minute incubation in 100% ethanol and then a two minute incubation in 100% ethanol. All slides were then dried for five to ten minutes before the tissue was placed into a microcentrifuge tube containing tumor lysis buffer and Proteinase K. Tubes were incubated at 55�C for three to 16hrs to allow for complete digestion and release of nucleic acids. Lysates were then aliquoted and store at ?80�C until isolation was performed. RNA was isolated using the High Pure FFPE RNA Micro Kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer�s protocol. DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit according to the manufacturer�s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA and DNA were stored at ?80�C until analyses were performed. Mutation and Gene Expression Analysis Genomic DNA was analyzed for mutations in AKT1 and PIK3CA as described previously [11]. RNA (10?100 ng) was subjected to a one-step cDNA synthesis/preamplification reaction using the Invitrogen Platinum Taq/Reverse Transcriptase enzyme mix as per the manufacturer�s protocol with the exception that PCR cycling conditions were changed from a 14 cycle preamplification to 18 cycles (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Following amplification, samples were diluted one to four with TE and qPCR was conducted on Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Arrays using the BioMark� HD system according to the manufacturer�s protocol and as previously described [12]. Samples were run in triplicate and cycle threshold (Ct) values were converted to relative expression values (negative delta Ct) by subtracting the mean of the six reference genes from the mean of each target gene. Hierarchical clustering was carried out on median-centered data with the complete linkage method using Cluster v3.0 and visualized using Treeview [13]. SNP analysis Cases where primary and metastatic samples were discordant for PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1 were verified to be from the same patient by SNP genotyping. Genomic DNA (25?100 ng) was preamplified with primer sets for 48 unique human SNPs for 14 cycles and analyzed using the Fluidigm SNPtype� assay platform according to the manufacturer�s protocol (Fluidigm Corporation, South San Francisco, CA). Data was analyzed in the automated genotype calling algorithm using the Fluidigm SNP Genotyping Software (v3.1.1). Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical software [14]. Differences in PIK3CA and AKT1 mutation and PTEN loss frequencies between paired primary and metastatic tumor samples was assessed using McNemar tests. Fluidigm raw Ct data were normalized by applying median normalization. Differential expression analysis was carried out employing Limma�s empirical Bayes moderated statistics [15]. Genes that were differentially expressed between primary and metastatic samples were identified using paired t statistics. Similarly, gene expression differences between the three subtypes were assessed using ANOVA models. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing errors using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Results PI3KCA mutation and PTEN prevalence and overlap in ER+ breast cancer A collection of FFPE ER+ breast tumors representing matched primary and metastatic samples (Table S1) were obtained to determine the prevalence and overlap of a panel of candidate biomarkers. Patients received a wide variety of hormonal and chemotherapy regimens in the adjuvant and front-line metastatic settings, and the metastatic samples were all collected at least six months after the primary sample, with a mean of 31 months and median of 19 months (Table S1). DNA extracted from each tumor pair was used to determine PIK3CA and AKT1 mutation status with a sensitive and specific qPCR-based assay [11], and serial sections from each tumor pair were also used to assess Ki67 staining and total PTEN loss via IHC (Table 1). PIK3CA mutation status was 90% concordant between primary and metastatic tumors (McNemar P?=?0.45), with a prevalence of 33% and 38%, respectively (Figure 1A and B, Table 1). One patient had two distinct hotspot mutations present in the primary tumor, while three patients showed two different mutations in the metastatic lesion (Figure 1A, Table 1). AKT1 mutation status was 99% concordant between primary and metastatic tumors (McNemar P?=?0.48), with a prevalence of 5.6% and 4.3%, respectively. PTEN status, when scored as presence or complete absence of staining by IHC, was 93% concordant between primary and metastatic tumors (McNemar P?=?0.62), with a prevalence of 5.6% and 7.1%, respectively. Intermediate levels of PTEN staining were also evaluated using an H-score, and were found to show moderate to high correlation between primary and metastatic samples (Pearson r?=?0.58, Figure 1C). In the case of all three biomarkers, examples of presence in the primary and absence in the metastatic sample were apparent, suggesting that the discordance cannot simply be explained by the acquisition of the alteration over time and after treatment. In addition, alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 and PTEN were generally non-overlapping (Figure 1A and B, Table 1), with two exceptions. In one case, a patient with PIK3CA mutations in both primary and metastatic samples showed low PTEN expression in the primary tumor and was PTEN null in the metastatic sample (Figure 1A, Table 1)."
Breast_Cancer "In a second case, a patient with a PIK3CA mutation in the metastatic sample showed PTEN loss in the primary tumor, though the metastatic sample was not evaluable for PTEN (Figure 1A, Table 1). Overall 44% of primary and 49% of metastatic samples showed evidence of PI3K pathway activation based on analysis of these three markers (Figure 1B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g001 Figure 1 PI3K pathway alterations in primary and metastatic ER+ breast cancers.

Relationship between Ki67 expression and PI3K pathway status IHC for the nuclear antigen Ki67 is a widely used assay for determining relative proliferation rates between tumor samples and has both predictive and prognostic implications [16]. We assessed Ki67 staining via IHC across the collection of paired primary and metastatic samples using criteria recommended by the international Ki67 working group [16]. Overall Ki67 intensity levels were well correlated between primary and metastatic samples (Pearson r?=?0.76, Figure 2A). PIK3CA mutations have in some studies been linked to reduced pathway signaling and better prognosis [17], [18], so we examined whether Ki67 percent positivity was inversely associated with PI3K pathway alterations. We found no significant difference in Ki67 levels in either primary or metastatic tumors when comparing tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations, AKT mutations, or loss of PTEN expression to tumors with no detected pathway alterations (Figure 2B and 2C). However, primary tumors with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations had higher average Ki67 levels than tumors with exon 9 mutations (p?=?0.049, Figure 2B), suggesting some subtleties between the two main classes of PIK3CA mutations. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g002 Figure 2 Ki67 status in primary and metastatic samples and relationship to PI3K pathway activation.

Development of a microfluidic breast cancer gene expression assay In order to look more broadly at biological changes between primary and metastatic tumors, we developed a gene expression assay based on microfluidic qRT-PCR assessment that works robustly on limited amounts of FFPE tissue and allows for the simultaneous analysis of 90 genes (Figure 3A and Table S2). Content for the panel was based on assessment of genes with differential expression between breast cancer cell lines of known subtypes, published reports of proliferation markers, and genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and PI3K pathway signaling [9], [19]. The contents of the complete panel are shown in Table S2. Tumor specimens were macrodissected to enrich for tumor cells, and the isolated RNA subjected to preamplification with gene specific primers. Each assay was individually validated for linearity and sensitivity by testing on a range of RNA inputs (10?100 ng) from universal RNA (uRNA) and two FFPE samples (Figure 3B and Fig. S1). All non-reference gene assays were found to have a dynamic range of at least 50-fold across a test set of 30 breast tumor samples (Fig. S2). To further validate the panel, samples were run in duplicate on the same chip and found to show strong intra-chip reproducibility (Figure 3C). Inter-chip reproducibility was assessed by comparing the uRNA Ct values across seven independent chips. Correlation coefficients were at least 0.97 for all chips, and 0.99 for ten of the 21 chip comparisons (Figure 3D). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g003 Figure 3 Development of a high-throughput microfluidic gene expression assay for analysis of FFPE breast tumor samples.

(D) Inter-chip reproducibility of the breast cancer gene expression assay assessed by comparing Ct values of universal RNA across seven independent assay runs. R-squared values are indicated in boxes. Biological validation of the microfluidic breast cancer gene expression assay As a first step to biologically validate the content of the panel, RNA from a panel of 24 breast cancer cell lines of known molecular subtype [20], [21] was analyzed on the microfluidic gene expression platform. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the 90 gene assay organized the cell lines into appropriate luminal and basal-like clusters in all but two cases (Fig. S3). Next, RNA from thirty FFPE samples of known breast cancer subtype based on IHC for ER, PR and HER2 was run on the microfluidic gene expression platform and analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Figure 4A). The 90 gene panel was able to correctly cluster all but two samples into the appropriate subtype predicted based on IHC. An F-test was used to identify genes that showed a statistically significant difference between subtypes. ESR1, IGF1R, SCUBE2, IGFBP2, CCND1 and TWIST1 showed significant association with ER+ status (Figure 4B, Fig. S4). TFF1, PGR, XBP1, FOXA1 and GATA3 were overexpressed in both ER+ and HER2+ tumors, while ERBB2 and GRB7 were high specifically in HER2+ tumors (Figure 4C and D, respectively, Fig. S4). Genes enriched in triple negative tumors included CLDN1, MET, CDC25A, SPRY2, SNAI2, FOSL1 and BUB1 (Figure 4E, Fig. S4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g004 Figure 4 Biological validation of the breast cancer gene expression assay using samples of known immunohistochemical subtype.

Application of the gene expression panel to matched primary and metastatic tumor samples RNA from 61 of the matched ER+ tumor samples was analyzed using the microfluidic gene expression panel. As a first step, we compared MKI67 (the mRNA encoding Ki67 antigen) levels with protein levels determined by IHC (Figure 5A), and found a trend towards higher mRNA expression in tumors with higher nuclear Ki67 protein expression. Analysis of genes differentially expressed between Ki67 high and low primary samples, based on a cutoff of 15% positivity, identified the proliferation genes CDC25A, MYBL2, CCNB1 and CDK1 as showing significantly higher expression in Ki67high primary tumors (Figure 5B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g005 Figure 5 Ki67 protein and gene expression analysis.

(B) Differentially expressed genes associated with Ki67 high or low protein staining levels (p-values indicated). Ki67 ? 15%, N?=?16, Ki67 > 15%, N?=?48. We also compared overall gene expression status for the 90 genes between primary and metastatic tumor samples using a paired t-test. This analysis revealed a high level of overall correlation for the 90 gene panel between primary and metastatic samples (Figure 6A). Only six of the 90 genes evaluated showed a statistically significant change of greater than 1.5 fold between primary and metastatic samples (Figure 6B). Several of the genes are implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including TWIST1, SNAI2 and TGFB2. In addition, gene expression between matched primary and metastatic samples showed a significantly higher correlation (median Pearson r ?=? 0.92) than unmatched primary and metastatic samples (median Pearson r ?=? 0.82; Wilcoxon P < 0.001). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088401.g006 Figure 6 Gene expression correlations between matched primary and metastatic ER+ breast cancer tumor samples.

Discussion Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer is a disease that has a particularly long natural history, with more than half of all disease recurrences occurring six years or more after diagnosis, often after treatment with up to five years of adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy [22]. This long time frame could conceivably result in substantial tumor evolution under selective pressure from hormonal therapy, and changes in tumor molecular genetics could confound diagnostic evaluations based on archival tissue intended to guide therapy in the metastatic setting. Such tumor evolution has been extensively documented in matched primary and metastatic renal cell carcinomas [23] and has been examined at the sequence level in triple-negative breast cancer [24], but has not been studied extensively in ER+ breast cancer. Here we set out to understand how a panel of disease-relevant biomarkers changed between primary and metastatic ER+ breast cancer tissues collected a minimum of six months apart, and after adjuvant or front-line metastatic therapy. The panel of assays included a collection of PI3K pathway alterations, since this pathway appears to play a major cooperative role in ER+ cancers. Numerous studies have shown that PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated oncogene in ER+ breast cancer, occurring with a frequency of up to 45% in various tumor series [25], [26], [27]. PIK3CA mutations are thought to arise early in cancer development and to be selected for throughout breast cancer progression, as they can be found in ductal carcinoma in situ as well as invasive primary breast cancers and metastatic samples [7]. PIK3CA mutations have been associated with a modest negative effect on responsiveness to endocrine therapy in several neoadjuvant studies [28]. One model would be that acquisition of PIK3CA mutations contributes to resistance to such therapies and would be expected to show higher prevalence in samples collected after disease recurrence. Indeed, a previous study showed PIK3CA mutations may be discordant between primary and metastatic breast cancer, with a higher prevalence in metastatic samples [29]. In this study of 73 paired samples with data for both primary and metastatic samples, we identified five pairs with a mutation in metastatic tissue but not the primary tumor, and two samples with a mutation in the primary tumor but not the metastatic sample. Thus, acquisition of PIK3CA mutations does not appear to be a widespread resistance mechanism following hormonal and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. We also found activating mutations in AKT1 in a small percentage of cases, as has been reported previously [30]. Consistent with other recent reports [6], [7], our results suggest that discordance between PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in asynchronous samples may be due to heterogeneity in the primary cancer, where metastatic clones may be derived from either mutant or non-mutant progenitor cells, since discordance can occur in either direction. Our studies suggest a lower prevalence of PTEN loss than has recently been reported in other ER+ cohorts [6], between five and ten percent as opposed to nearly 30%. These findings could be explained by differences in the IHC assay or the patient population, but are also consistent with previous reports suggesting PTEN loss is more predominant in triple-negative breast cancer than hormone receptor positive disease [27], [31]. This finding may have implications for clinical trials attempting to validate PTEN as a diagnostic marker for PI3K targeting therapies in ER+ breast cancer. Notably, alterations in PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1 were generally non-overlapping, suggesting perhaps that they are functionally redundant in activating this signaling pathway. Unlike previous reports, we also addressed whether biomarker alterations in the PI3K pathway were associated with a reduced proliferation state, given previous studies suggesting that PIK3CA mutations are associated with low pathway output [17], [18] and favorable prognosis [32]. Importantly, we found Ki67 levels to be independent of PIK3CA mutation status or other alterations in the pathway, suggesting that selecting cohorts of patients based on pathway activation would not necessarily identify low risk patients with non-proliferative cancers. We did observe higher proliferation rates in exon 20 PIK3CA mutant cancers, consistent with previous reports showing differences in prognostic value between exon 9 and exon 20 mutations, though sometimes in opposing directions [33], [34]. The observed differences suggest these alterations should perhaps be evaluated independently in the context of predicting response to targeted therapies. Gene expression predictors of risk of recurrence have shown promise in early breast cancer, and are widely used to make therapeutic decisions (ie. hormonal versus chemotherapy) based on relative risk assessment [35]. As of yet, gene expression based assays have not seen widespread incorporation as predictive diagnostic tools in metastatic disease. Recent studies have suggested such signatures could have promise as a general method of determining the overall state of pathway activation [17]"
Breast_Cancer "or predicting response to targeted therapies [9], a conceptually appealing approach in that it may cast a wider net and identify patients who would be missed by single-analyte assays. Multiplex gene expression assays could also have applications in confirming molecular subtype, determination of epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype, or identifying more highly proliferative tumors. However, collection of fresh biopsies in patients with metastatic disease is not feasible in many cases, so clinical application of this technology requires demonstrating that molecular portraits inferred from primary, archival tumor material can give a reasonable facsimile of later metastatic disease. We have developed a microfluidic gene expression assay that retains the sensitivity and dynamic range of qRT-PCR and allows simultaneous evaluation of 90 genes relevant to breast cancer subtyping, proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal biology and PI3K pathway signaling from small amounts of RNA extracted from FFPE tissue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of procured tumor samples of known IHC subtype suggested this assay can efficiently group breast tumor samples into the three major subtypes of hormone receptor positive, HER2+ and triple negative breast cancer. Consistent with expectations, canonical luminal genes such as ESR1, GATA3, FOXA1, TFF1 and IGF1R were higher in ER+ samples compared to triple negative samples, while proliferation and mesenchymal genes such as SPRY2, SNAI2, FOSL1, MET and BUB1 were higher in triple negative cancers. Importantly, analysis of the matched primary and metastatic ER+ breast tumor samples with the microfluidic gene expression assay suggested a generally high degree of concordance, with only six of 90 genes showing more than a 1.5 fold difference between matched primary and metastatic tissue and very high intra-patient correlation between primary and metastatic tumors. Intriguingly, the genes differentially expressed between matched tumor pairs included TWIST and SNAIL2, which have a well-documented role in metastasis via regulating E-cadherin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [36], [37]. Surprisingly, these genes were more highly expressed in primary relative to metastatic samples, suggesting perhaps that these genes are upregulated in the premetastatic state. We also examined the potential of the gene expression panel to identify more proliferative tumors, as tumors with a higher proliferation index may respond differentially to targeted therapies. Since the majority of samples in this study showed greater than 15% Ki67, the sample set was likely biased towards more proliferative, luminal B type tumors [38]. Nevertheless, we saw excellent general agreement between Ki67 staining by IHC and MKI67 mRNA levels determined by the microfluidic platform. Moreover, Ki67 high tumors showed higher expression of proliferation genes such as CDC25A, CCNB1 and CDK1, suggesting possible utility in identifying tumors with greater proliferative potential. Over the past 10-15 years, a wealth of information has emerged on the molecular portraits and genomic architecture of breast cancers [25], [26], [27], [39]. However, routine clinical assessment of molecular features of breast cancers in patients with metastatic cancer has lagged behind due to challenges in assessing molecular changes in fixed archival tissues. Here we describe a panel of assays that has been optimized for fixed tissue and which allows reasonably comprehensive assessment of a range of biological pathways and processes. The microfluidic gene expression assay has broad content selected from the collective literature of breast cancer biology and subtypes, and has potential applications to characterize patient samples based on signaling pathway status and biological processes such as EMT. Moreover, the overall platform of assays we describe in this study could have considerable impact on identifying patient subsets responsive to therapeutics targeting the PI3K/mTOR axis. Careful application of the panel of assays to clinical samples may yield answers to questions such as whether clinical benefit is associated with a specific pathway alteration (i.e. PIK3CA mutations compared to PTEN), whether patients with more proliferative tumors show differential benefit to such agents, and the role of gene signatures in predicting response and resistance to these agents. The outcome of these trials is eagerly anticipated in the field.

Numerous factors have been hypothesized to modify these risks, but studies are of variable quality, and it remains unclear which of these may be of value in clinical risk assessment. Methods PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published through September 2013. Fixed effects meta-analysis was done using the hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to estimate the pooled effect estimates (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify factors that are associated with cancer risk modification in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Results We identified 44 nonoverlapping studies that met predefined quality criteria. Sufficient evidence is available to make clinically relevant inferences about a number of cancer risk modifiers."
Breast_Cancer "The only variable examined that produced a probable association was late age at first live birth, a meta-analysis showed a decrease in the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers with women aged 30 years or older vs. women younger than 30 years (ES = 0.65; 95% CI =0.42 to 0.99). The same was shown for women aged 25 to 29 years versus those aged less than 25 years (ES = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.99). Breastfeeding and tubal ligation were associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers; oral contraceptives were associated with reduced risk among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Smoking was associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers only. Conclusions Data assessing many potential risk modifiers are inadequate, and many have not been externally validated. Although additional studies are required to confirm some associations, sufficient information is available for some risk factors to be used in risk counseling or lifestyle modification to minimize cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

In contrast, mouse embryos develop normally, despite the expression of mutant p53. Here, we report that, in ES cells, mutant p53 conformation is shifted to a WT form, leading to transcriptionally active p53 and increased genomic integrity of these cells. Using MS-based proteomics, we were able to isolate a network of interacting proteins that bind mutant p53 and stabilize it to the WT form. These results can serve as a potential platform for p53-based cancer therapy development in the future. p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor that is mutated in over 50% of human cancers. These mutations were shown to exhibit gain of oncogenic function compared with the deletion of the gene. Additionally, p53 has fundamental roles in differentiation and development; nevertheless, mutant p53 mice are viable and develop malignant tumors only on adulthood. We set out to reveal the mechanisms by which embryos are protected from mutant p53�induced transformation using ES cells (ESCs) that express a conformational mutant of p53. We found that, despite harboring mutant p53, the ESCs remain pluripotent and benign and have relatively normal karyotype compared with ESCs knocked out for p53. Additionally, using high-content RNA sequencing, we show that p53 is transcriptionally active in response to DNA damage in mutant ESCs and elevates p53 target genes, such as p21 and btg2. We also show that the conformation of mutant p53 protein in ESCs is stabilized to a WT conformation. Through MS-based interactome analyses, we identified a network of proteins, including the CCT complex, USP7, Aurora kinase, Nedd4, and Trim24, that bind mutant p53 and may shift its conformation to a WT form. We propose this conformational shift as a novel mechanism of maintenance of genomic integrity, despite p53 mutation. Harnessing the ability of these protein interactors to transform the oncogenic mutant p53 to the tumor suppressor WT form can be the basis for future development of p53-targeted cancer therapy. 9101000 2221 Womens Health Issues Womens Health Issues Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health 1049-3867 1878-4321 24439942 3896921 10.1016/j.whi.2013.10.010 NIHMS537288 Article Barriers reported among patients with breast and cervical abnormalities in the patient navigation research program: impact on timely care Katz Mira L. 1 Young Gregory S. 1 Reiter Paul L. 1 Battaglia Tracy A. 2 Wells Kristen J. 3 Sanders Mechelle 4 Simon Melissa 5 Dudley Donald J. 6 Patierno Steven R. 7 Paskett Electra D. 1 1The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 2Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 3San Diego State University, San Diego, California 4University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 5Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 6University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 7The George Washington University, Washington, DC Correspondence, Mira L.

Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2013 Background Patient navigation (PN) is a system-level strategy to decrease cancer mortality rates by reducing barriers to cancer care. Barriers to resolution among participants in the PN intervention arm with a breast or cervical abnormality in the Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP) and navigators� actions to address those barriers were examined. Methods Data were from seven institutions (2005 to 2010) included 1,995 breast and 1,194 cervical patients. A stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the effects of barriers on time to resolution of an abnormal screening test or clinical finding. Findings The range of unique barriers was 0 to 12 and 0 to 7 among participants with breast and cervical abnormalities, respectively. About two-thirds of breast and half of cervical participants had at least one barrier resulting in longer time to diagnostic resolution among breast (adjusted HR=0.744; p<0.001) and cervical (adjusted HR=0.792; p<0.001) participants. Patient-level and system-level barriers were most common. Frequent navigator actions were: making arrangements, scheduling appointments, referrals, and education. Conclusions Having a barrier resulted in a delay in diagnostic resolution of an abnormal screening test or clinical finding. Health care systems can use these findings to improve existing PN programs or when developing new programs. patient navigation patient navigators patient-centered care cancer National Cancer Institute : NCI P30 CA016058 || CA 9302957 8479 Support Care Cancer Support Care Cancer Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer 0941-4355 1433-7339 24249424 3943705 10.1007/s00520-013-2038-6 NIHMS541974 Article Motivation, Exercise and Stress in Breast Cancer Survivors Cuevas Brandi T. 1 Hughes Daniel C.

Exercise behaviors are linked to motivational factors. We investigated the associations between motivational profile, self-reported levels of PA and stress and mental functioning in 94 post-treatment breast cancer survivors who voluntarily enrolled in an exercise program. Methods Participants completed Apter Motivational Style Profile (AMSP), Life Time of Physical Activity (LTPA) Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Medical Outcomes Short Form SF-36� (SF-36), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and provided 10 saliva specimens (to measure cortisol levels). PA levels were calculated in metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-hrs/wk). Results Participants reported high levels of current and historical PA (M = 39.2 MET-hrs/wk, SD = 39.7; M = 14.2 MET-hrs/wk, SD = 15.4, respectively). They also reported high levels of stress (M = 33.6, SD = 4.5) coupled with low mental functionality as measured by SF-36 Mental Components Scale (MCS) (M = 44.4, SD = 8.8). PSS was negatively associated with MCS (r = ?0.27, p = 0.009). Salivary cortisol was not associated with any measure. Participants had a conformist (�follow rules�) and alloic (�about others�) motivational profile. No motivational, exercise history or stress variables were associated with current PA. Conclusions As expected, participants reported higher levels of stress and lower mental functioning. Participants presented a unique motivational profile relative to the general population. Further research into the associations of motivation, exercise behaviors and stress are warranted. stress breast cancer exercise motivation PLoS One PLoS ONE plos plosone PLoS ONE 1932-6203 Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 24392158 3879327 PONE-D-13-37384 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835 Research Article Medicine Drugs and Devices Pharmacoepidemiology Epidemiology Cancer Epidemiology Pharmacoepidemiology Obstetrics and Gynecology Breast Cancer Oncology Cancer Treatment Endocrine Therapy Cancers and Neoplasms Breast Tumors Women's Health Osteopenia and Osteoporosis Women Commencing Anastrozole, Letrozole or Tamoxifen for Early Breast Cancer: The Impact of Comorbidity and Demographics on Initial Choice Endocrine Therapy Choice Kemp Anna 1 * Preen David B. 1 Saunders Christobel 2 Boyle Frances 3 Bulsara Max 4 Holman C.

Background Australian clinical guidelines recommend endocrine therapy for all women with hormone-dependent early breast cancer. Guidelines specify tamoxifen as first-line therapy for pre-menopausal women, and tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for post-menopausal women depending on the risk of recurrence based on tumour characteristics including size. Therapies have different side effect profiles; therefore comorbidity may also influence choice. We examined comorbidity, and the clinical and demographic characteristics of women commencing different therapies. Patients and Methods We identified the first dispensing of tamoxifen, anastrozole or letrozole for women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the 45 and Up Study from 2004�2009 (N?=?1266). Unit-level pharmacy and medical service claims, hospital, Cancer Registry, and self-reported data were linked to determine menopause status at diagnosis, tumour size, age, comorbidities, and change in subsidy restrictions. Chi-square tests and generalised regression models were used to compare the characteristics of women commencing different therapies. Results Most pre-menopausal women commenced therapy with tamoxifen (91%). Anastrozole was the predominant therapy for post-menopausal women (57%), followed by tamoxifen (28%). Women with osteoporosis were less likely to commence anastrozole compared with tamoxifen (anastrozole RR?=?0.7, 95% CI?=?0.5�0.9). Women with arthritis were 1.6-times more likely to commence letrozole than anastrozole (95% CI?=?1.1�2.1). Tamoxifen was more often initiated in women with tumours >1 cm, who were also ?75 years. Subsidy restriction changes were associated with substantial increases in the proportion of women commencing AIs (anastrozole RR?=?4.3, letrozole RR?=?8.3). Conclusions The findings indicate interplay of comorbidity and therapy choice for women with invasive breast cancer. Most post-menopausal women commenced therapy with anastrozole; however, letrozole and tamoxifen were more often initiated for women with comorbid arthritis and osteoporosis, respectively. Tamoxifen was also more common for women with tumours >1 cm and aged ?75 years. Subsidy restrictions appear to have strongly influenced therapy choice. This work was jointly-funded by Cancer Australia and the National Breast Cancer Foundation [Priority-driven Collaborative Cancer Research Scheme 1011488 to AK, DBP, CS, MB, CDJH, and EER]. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Introduction Endocrine therapy is the foundation of post-surgical treatment for women with hormone-dependent early breast cancer [1]. Therapy acts to either block the production of oestrogen or the stimulatory action of oestrogen on tumour cells [1]. When taken for five years, endocrine therapies halve the risk of recurrence and significantly reduce cancer-related mortality [2]�[4]. Clinical trial evidence supports the use of tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor (AI); anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, as first-line endocrine therapy [2], [4], [5]. The effectiveness and tolerability of these therapies varies depending on the menopause status and clinical characteristics of the individual woman [6]. AIs act by inhibiting the production of oestrogen in non-ovarian tissue and are, therefore, only suitable for women whose ovarian production of oestrogen has ceased (i.e. they are post-menopausal) [1], [3]. Anastrozole and letrozole have superior disease-free survival to tamoxifen in post-menopausal women [5], [7], [8]; however, their use is associated with musculoskeletal pain, decreased bone density, increased risk of fractures, and cardiovascular disease [2], [5], [9], [10]. Clinicians or patients may be hesitant to use AIs where there is a history of arthritis, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction. Tamoxifen is suitable for use in either pre- or post-menopausal women [3]. Tamoxifen may be better tolerated by elderly women [8] but is associated with an elevated risk of endometrial complications including cancer, and thromboembolic events [1], [4]. Clinicians and patients hay be hesitant to commence tamoxifen, therefore, where there is a history of endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) or stroke. Tamoxifen, anastrozole and letrozole are the publically-subsidised first-line therapies for treatment of hormone-dependent early breast cancer in Australia [11]. Current Australian clinical guidelines recommend post-surgical endocrine therapy for all women with hormone-dependent early breast cancer, and indicate specific therapies for post-menopausal women depending on recurrence risk, which is defined according to tumour characteristics including size [12] (Table 1). Guidelines indicate that therapy choice should be based on the likely risks and benefits for each individual but guidelines are not specific in relation to comorbidity [12], [13]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835.t001 Table 1 Australian clinical guidelines for endocrine therapy use in women with hormone-dependent early breast cancer [12], [13]. Menopause status Treatment guidelines Pre-menopausal Tamoxifen only Post-menopausal Choice of endocrine therapy based on risk of recurrence High risk (tumours >2 cm) � Endocrine therapy should commence with an aromatase inhibitor Intermediate risk (tumours 1.1�2 cm) � Adjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is recommended Low risk (tumours ?1 cm) � Treatment with tamoxifen is recommended rather than with an aromatase inhibitor as the balance between benefits and harms of aromatase inhibitor is unclear for such women It is not known whether prescribing of endocrine therapies in Australian practice is consistent with current guidelines in terms of menopause status and recurrence risk. It is unclear whether comorbidity is considered when selecting an endocrine therapy, or which therapy is chosen in instances where menopause status, recurrence risk or comorbidity alone point to different therapies. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and demographic characteristics of women commencing different endocrine therapies for early breast cancer in Australian practice. Methods Ethics Statement Participants were drawn from the 45 and Up Study cohort. All cohort members provided written consent to join 45 and Up Study, have their routinely-collected health data linked, and for these data to be provided to third-party researchers for approved projects. This consent procedure was approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee and the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. The current study also received approval from The University of Western Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (approval RA/4/1/4589) and the NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee (approval HREC/11/CIPHS/35). Study Sample Cases were selected from participants enrolled in the 45 and Up Study; a cohort of approximately 267,000 adults (143,014 women) aged ?45 years residing in New South Wales (NSW), Australia [14]. Participants joined the study between January 2006-April 2009 and completed a baseline questionnaire of demographic and health-related items [15]. Baseline data were linked to pharmaceutical and medical service claims subsidised by the Australian government and other datasets can be linked on a project-by-project basis. Information regarding the establishment and recruitment of the cohort are described elsewhere [14]. Data Sources and Linkage We accessed unit-record, linked data from: i) the 45 and Up Study baseline survey, ii) NSW Cancer Registry, iii) NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection, iv) Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claims, and v) Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims. Linkage of PBS and MBS data were conducted by the Department of Human Services, and remaining datasets by the NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage [16]. Researchers were provided with de-identified data only. The study period was defined as 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2011. Inclusion Criteria Cases included in the study were women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer between January 2004-December 2009, ascertained through the: i) NSW Cancer Registry and ii) Admitted Patient Data Collection. The Cancer Registry contains, by statutory requirement, records of all cancers diagnosed or treated in NSW [17], [18] and is considered the �gold standard� for cancer identification for research purposes [18]. Women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer listed on the Cancer Registry between January 2004-December 2008 were included in the study (N?=?2240). International Classification of Diseases version 10 with Australian modifications (ICD-10-AM) codes C50.0-C50.9 were used to identify cases [19]. The month and year of diagnosis recorded on the Cancer Registry were considered the diagnosis date. The NSW Cancer Registry has not released incidence data since the end of 2008 [20]. Therefore, cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 2009 were identified by inpatient primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with the same ICD-10-AM codes (N?=?470). The first admission with this diagnosis for these women was considered the diagnosis date. Hospital-derived diagnosis had a positive predictive value and sensitivity of 86%, and specificity of 99.9%, compared with the Cancer Registry [20], [21]. Sensitivity analyses showed that 53% of women with a Cancer Registry diagnosis had an inpatient diagnosis within the same calendar month, and 93% within one calendar month. Identifying the Initial Endocrine Therapy We identified claims for dispensing of prescribed medicines listed on the PBS. The PBS entitles all Australian citizens and permanent residents to subsidised medicines [22]. Initial therapy was defined as the first PBS record for tamoxifen (PBS items 2109B, 2110C), anastrozole (8179L) or letrozole (8245Y) within 18 months of follow-up from diagnosis. We did not include exemestane as it was restricted to advanced breast cancer [23]. The 18-month follow-up period was chosen based on evidence that endocrine therapy is initiated within this timeframe [21], [24]. Of the 1832 women in our dataset dispensed an endocrine therapy during the study period, sensitivity analysis showed that 96% (N?=?1763) had been dispensed a therapy within 18 months of diagnosis. Exclusion Criteria Women with metastatic cancer at diagnosis (N?=?47) or whose menopause status at diagnosis could not be ascertained (N?=?425, described below) were excluded. Individuals were also excluded if they did not have an endocrine therapy dispensed within 18 months of diagnosis (N?=?947) or were dispensed an endocrine therapy before diagnosis (N?=?25). The final study sample comprised 1266 women. Comorbidities Comorbid osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (�arthritis�), atrial fibrillation, DVT or PE, endometrial cancer, myocardial infarction (MI), osteoporosis, and stroke were ascertained as history of these conditions may influence therapy choice. Comorbidity was defined by: i) dispensing of ?1 specified PBS items prior to diagnosis, or ii) a hospital admission with specified ICD-10-AM codes in the primary or other diagnosis field prior to diagnosis (Table 2). Medicines for DVT and PE are not specific to these conditions; therefore, these comorbidities were identified by ?1 enoxaparin, heparin or warfarin dispensing, with an MBS claim for venous Doppler ultrasound, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography, D-dimer blood test, or a ventilation perfusion lung scan prior to diagnosis. 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835.t002 Table 2 Diagnosis, pharmacy and procedure codes used to identify history of specified conditions.

Stroke I63.0�I63.9 � � Ascertaining Menopause Status Menopause status at diagnosis was derived from: i) age at diagnosis, ii) self-reported menopause status provided in the 45 and Up Study baseline survey, or iii) whether the baseline survey was completed before or after diagnosis. Women were classified as post-menopausal if they were aged ?55 years at diagnosis [6], or if they were <55 years and reported being post-menopausal before diagnosis. Women aged <55 years at diagnosis and reporting being pre-menopausal after diagnosis were classified as pre-menopausal. The rest of the women aged <55 who reported: i) being pre-menopausal before diagnosis, ii) post-menopausal after diagnosis, or iii) unknown menopause status were classified as having �unknown menopause status�, since their status could have changed between time of reporting and diagnosis. Other Covariates Tumour stage and size were listed in the Cancer Registry. Stage data were provided as �localised�, �regionalised�, �distant�, or �unknown or missing�. Tumour size was categorised as �?1 cm�, �>1�2 cm�, �>2 cm�, or �unknown or missing�. Residential location was assessed using the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA+) [25]. Area disadvantage was assessed using the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas [26] divided into tertiles. Prior to December 2005, anastrozole was only PBS-subsidised for advanced breast cancer or for early breast cancer where tamoxifen was contra-indicated or not tolerated [27]. Before December 2006 letrozole was restricted for treatment of advanced breast cancer only [28]. After these respective dates clinicians could prescribe anastrozole or letrozole for any hormone-dependent breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Therefore, we included a term to represent therapies dispensed before or after the subsidy restriction changes (before/after December 2005 and before/after December 2006). The PBS dataset did not capture dispensing to �general� beneficiaries for medicines priced below the co-payment during the study period (A$33.30 in 2010) [29]. Most of the medicines examined were priced above this co-payment and were therefore captured. However, all the arthritis medicines, warfarin and some heparin cost less than the co-payment and were only captured for the subset of participants receiving social security (62%). Statistical Analyses Chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used to compare the characteristics of women initially dispensed tamoxifen, anastrozole or letrozole. Further chi-square tests were conducted to compare the proportion of women with specified characteristics dispensed different therapies, stratified by tumour size. Multivariate modified Poisson regression models were conducted to determine the associations between patient characteristics and dispensing of different therapies. The dependent variables for these models were binary: the number of women commencing therapy with; i) anastrozole compared with tamoxifen, ii) letrozole compared with tamoxifen, and iii) letrozole compared with anastrozole. A modified regression approach was selected over logistic regression because the outcomes (numbers of women commencing specific therapies) were not rare [30]. All variables which varied by therapy type in the previous analyses (P?0.05) were included in the multivariate models. Adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each variable. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact on the multivariate analyses of: i) changing the menopause age cut-off from 55 to 58 years and ii) removing the 2009 cases identified through hospital records. Changing the menopause cut-off did not alter the results of the multivariate analyses (results not shown). Removing the 2009 cases did not influence the RR but resulted in wider CIs for comorbidity variables due to reduced power (results not shown). Therefore, we retained the menopause cut-off at 55 years and included the 2009 cases in the final analyses. All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 19."
Breast_Cancer "Results Unadjusted Analyses Of the 1266 women included in the final sample, 55 were pre-menopausal at diagnosis and 1211 were post-menopausal. The majority of pre-menopausal women (91%) commenced therapy with tamoxifen. Only five pre-menopausal women were initiated on anastrozole or letrozole. Choice of initial therapy for post-menopausal women changed substantially after subsidy restriction changes. Therefore, the unadjusted comparisons of patient characteristics and initial therapy were restricted to women commencing therapy from December 2005 (N?=?919). Anastrozole was the most commonly initiated therapy for post-menopausal women (57%), followed by tamoxifen (28%) (Table 3). Choice of therapy varied significantly by age, tumour size and stage. Women commencing tamoxifen were more likely to be ?75 years, have tumours ?1 cm and have localised tumours compared with women commencing anastrozole or letrozole. Residential location, disadvantage, and birth country did not vary by initial therapy. Women initiated on anastrozole were more likely to have regionalised tumours compared with those commencing other therapies. Tamoxifen was initiated more often than other therapies for women with osteoporosis, and letrozole more often in women with arthritis. Therapy type did not vary by history of atrial fibrillation, DVT or PE, endometrial cancer, MI, or stroke. 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835.t003 Table 3 Characteristics of post-menopausal women commencing therapy with tamoxifen, anastrozole or letrozole between December 2005 and December 2010.

Characteristics of Women Initiated with Different Therapies Stratified by Tumour Size The impact of the change to subsidy restrictions was observed for women with tumours of all sizes (Figure 1a). Age significantly impacted on therapy type for women with intermediate (>1�2 cm) or large (>2 cm) tumours (Figure 1b). Women aged ?75 years and with intermediate or large tumours were more likely to commence tamoxifen than women 55�74 years (intermediate 45% vs. 26%, P?=?0.017; large 38% vs. 19%, P?=?0.009), and were less likely to commence anastrozole (intermediate 39% vs. 62%, P?=?0.005; large 50% vs. 67%, P?=?0.028). 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835.g001 Figure 1 a�b: Proportion of post-menopausal women commencing different endocrine therapies, by specified characteristics, and stratified for tumour size. 1a includes women commencing therapy between January 2004-December 2010. 1b is restricted to women commencing therapy between December 2005-December 2010 to reflect practice after the subsidy restriction changes. *Difference of P<0.05 in the proportion of women commencing tamoxifen. �Difference of P<0.05 in the proportion of women commencing anastrozole. � Difference of P<0.05 in the proportion of women commencing letrozole. Adjusted Analyses Multivariate analyses showed that women were 4-times more likely to commence treatment with anastrozole than tamoxifen following the restriction changes (95% CI?=?3.1�5.9), and more than 8-times more likely to commence with letrozole (95% CI?=?4.1�16.5) (Table 4). Age did not impact on therapy choice after adjustment for other covariates. Women with large tumours were significantly more likely to commence therapy with an AI than tamoxifen (anastrozole vs. tamoxifen RR?=?1.4, 95% CI?=?1.0�1.9, P?=?0.039; letrozole vs. tamoxifen RR?=?2.0, 95% CI?=?1.1�3.8, P?=?0.030). Women with regionalised tumours were also significantly more likely to be initiated on anastrozole than tamoxifen (RR?=?1.3, 95% CI?=?1.0�1.5, P?=?0.028). 10.1371/journal.pone.0084835.t004 Table 4 Results from multivariate Poisson regression models: impact of clinical and demographic characteristics on commencing different endocrine therapies between January 2004 and December 2010 for post-menopausal women with invasive breast cancer.

Women with osteoporosis were 31% less likely to be initiated on anastrozole than tamoxifen (RR?=?0.7, 95% CI?=?0.5�0.9, P?=?0.020), and 41% less likely to commence letrozole compared with tamoxifen (RR?=?0.6, 95% CI?=?0.3�1.0, P?=?0.055). Post-menopausal women with arthritis were 1.6-times more likely to be initiated on letrozole compared with anastrozole (95% CI?=?1.1�2.1, P?=?0.009). Discussion Clinical guidelines recommend particular therapies based on tumour characteristics including size, and choice may be influenced by comorbidity; but women can have both. The majority of post-menopausal women were initiated on anastrozole or letrozole; however there was evidence of comorbidity being considered when selecting initial therapy. Women with osteoporosis were significantly more likely to commence with tamoxifen compared to women without osteoporosis. Contrary to what might have been expected, women with arthritis were not more likely to commence therapy with tamoxifen but were significantly more likely to begin with letrozole. Recent evidence suggests that letrozole may be better tolerated by women with arthritis than anastrozole [31], [32], and clinicians may have considered this AI a better alternative to anastrozole than tamoxifen given its superior efficacy [8], [33]. Trade-offs were apparent for women ?75 years with intermediate or large tumours, who were more likely to commence therapy with tamoxifen than their younger counterparts. Tamoxifen is often better tolerated by the elderly [8], and clinicians may be trading-off these benefits over the possibility of decreased disease-free survival in this group. Our findings suggest that pharmaceutical insurance policies have a large impact on therapy choice for women with early breast cancer. Restriction changes in 2005 and 2006 allowed public-subsidy of anastrozole and letrozole for all post-menopausal women with hormone-dependent tumours [27], [28]. These subsidy changes effectively reduced the monthly out-of-pocket cost of AIs from approximately $150 to <$35 [23] and increased the likelihood of commencing an AI by between 4- and 8-times. This shift represents appropriate prescribing in post-menopausal women with intermediate and large tumours. Current guidelines do not recommend AIs for women with tumours ?1 cm given the unclear balance of risks and benefits in this group [13]. Consistent with current clinical guidelines the vast majority of pre-menopausal women in this study (91%) commenced therapy with tamoxifen [12]. Only five pre-menopausal women commenced therapy with an AI. Further investigation indicated that these women had received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, which may have led to iatrogenic menopause. This may have been the reason they commenced on an AI; alternatively, these women may represent a minority receiving inappropriate prescribing. Demographic characteristics such as area disadvantage, residential remoteness and being born outside Australia did not impact on therapy type. We found no evidence to indicate that prior atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE, MI or stroke were considered when selecting therapy; however we were underpowered for these comparisons. Strengths and Weaknesses To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the factors associated with incident dispensing of endocrine therapies to women with invasive breast cancer; either in Australia or elsewhere. Consequently, this study provides the first evidence of the clinical practice of endocrine therapy for early breast cancer outside trial conditions. We have used health and medical records for a heterogeneous community sample for whom all publically-subsidised endocrine therapies have been captured. Some limitations exist which may have implications for this study. Our sample was drawn from the 45 and Up Study, limiting the sample to individuals ?45 years and consenting to linkage of their health records. The health service history of such individuals may differ from younger people, or those do not agree to participate in cohort studies. Although we could not directly ascertain whether participants had hormone-dependent tumours, endocrine therapies in Australia are only publically-subsidised for hormone-dependent tumours [11]. Only women without hormone-dependant tumours or using therapies for primary prevention would be ineligible for publically-subsidised therapy [11]. We were limited to analysing women who commenced therapy and could not determine how many women were never prescribed endocrine therapy, or did not fill an initial prescription. We were not able to assess the role of patient preference in selection of therapy. Comorbidity was identified through hospital records and dispensing of medicines, with up to eight years of data available depending on diagnosis date. Consequently, we may have misclassified participants not receiving hospital or pharmaceutical treatment. Under-ascertainment of some medicines may have occurred for participants without social security status during the study period. Conclusion The findings indicate that there is interplay of comorbidity and choice of therapy for women with invasive breast cancer."
Breast_Cancer "Background The effectiveness of multiple innovative recruitment strategies for enrolling Black/African American participants to the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) is described. The study�s focus is diet and breast, prostate and colon cancer. Methods Promotions centered on trust, relationship building and incentives for increasing enrollment and questionnaire return rate. Of the sub-studies described, one had a randomized control group, and the others, informal controls. The subjects are from all states of the U.S. and some provinces of Canada. The offer of a Black art piece, follow-up calls, a competitive tournament as well as other strategies accounted for nearly 3,000 additional returns even though they were often used in small subsets. Results Flexibility and multiple strategies proved advantageous in gaining the cooperation of Blacks, who are usually reluctant to participate in research studies. Conclusions Lessons learned during initial enrollment should help us retain our final Black cohort of 26,000, and obtain new information when required. Black African American Enrollment Recruitment Promotion Re-promotion Revisit Multiple strategies Incentives Sub-studies Background Minorities are under-represented in research studies and enrolling them in dietary cohort studies with long questionnaires, is particularly challenging [1-5] Therefore, it is not surprising that nearly 20 years following the National Institute of Health (NIH) requirement to increase the number of minorities in research studies [6], the response remains very modest. Our experience with Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) and the methods that were tried, contribute to an understanding of this deficiency, but also to ways to help overcome the problem. AHS-2 is one of a relatively small number of contemporary cohorts containing a large number of Black participants. Its major aims are to investigate the associations between dietary soy, dairy, calcium, and long chain fatty acids, and the risk of prostate, colon, and breast cancers. We also aim to compare dietary patterns and other lifestyle risk factors, between racial groups, hoping to explain health disparities across populations. The initial Black recruitment goal was 35,000 returned questionnaires from Black church members and we finally achieved 25,662, a gratifying result as we subsequently estimated that this represented about 30% of the estimated source population, at least as good as that achieved for non-Blacks in AHS-2. Recruitment consisted of systematically approaching church members throughout the U.S. and Canada to enroll in the study, starting on the west coast and proceeding eastward, then to the South and Canada. This effort lasted for five years (2002�2007). Participants were considered enrolled in the AHS-2 if they completed an enrollment card signifying their desire to participate in the study. They then received a questionnaire from the study headquarters and completed the 50-page self-administered instrument. Once this was mailed to us, they then became official study participants. Our initial recruitment model fully described elsewhere [7,8], was church-based. Briefly, each of 1003 Black churches were provided and adopted an enrollment goal based on their usual adult attendance. The pastor and a layperson (church recruiter) were selected to represent the study to their congregation and were trained by study investigators, either in person or by telephone. Pastors and church recruiters received a monetary incentive for their promotional efforts, and all Black respondents who returned a questionnaire were mailed a check for $10. The initial strategy included multiple announcements and enrollment requests directed to members who attended church during a 12�16 week period. We became aware early on however, that although the initial promotional/recruitment model was very effective, that achieving our goal of 35,000 would be challenging. Thus, our team of researchers and local church recruiters proposed a number of other novel ancillary recruitment strategies which we implemented to follow the initial recruitment model as resources allowed. Mostly this was in one region of the country, as the new methods were only being tested rather than implemented generally, and this was usually in a region where the study was promoting or re-promoting questionnaire return at that time. In most of these sub-studies, subjects would have already requested and received a questionnaire, but not yet returned it. Exceptions are the two �Enroll Another� studies (explained later) where subjects had already completed and returned their questionnaires, but they then enrolled new members and encouraged them to return the questionnaires. In 2004, after nearly three years of recruiting we had covered the West Coast, the Mid-West and much of the East Coast, using the basic promotional/recruitment model plus telephone follow-up (the first ancillary method tested). At this time we launched a re-promotion campaign in an effort to improve the questionnaire return rate from churches where initial promotion was concluded but where goals had not been reached [7]. In addition, successful strategies could be added to the promotional plan in areas not yet reached. During this re-promotion, all pastors� monetary incentives increased from $350 to $1,000 for large churches (goals taking values greater than 30 completed questionnaires), and to $500 for smaller churches (goals taking values less than 30) and incentives were prorated according to the proportion of the goal achieved. Study-wide, the local church recruiters also received, during re-promotion, an increased prorated monetary incentive (between $100 - $200 depending on church size). As these increases were applied across all churches their effectiveness could not be tested in this study. In this paper, we evaluate these ancillary recruitment strategies. Although, with one exception [9] the sub-studies described here were not originally designed for formal assessment, it has often proved possible to put together useful control observations, and so estimate the effect of the method to increase enrollment. These observations will also be of interest to other researchers who plan to involve Blacks/African Americans in their studies. Methods The main goal of the additional sub-studies used in this re-promotion was to rapidly increase questionnaire returns. Thus, the timing of the additional strategies, with respect to the main AHS-2 recruitment model, was variable and different strategies started at various times (see Table  1). As it is likely that recruitment at later times was more difficult, given that the remaining target population had not been persuaded by earlier approaches, we group the various approaches by the time of application: a) Sub-studies part of initial promotion; and b) Later re-approach strategies. a) Sub-studies part of initial promotion Follow-up telephone calls: Members of 40 Black churches participated in a sub-study to test the effectiveness of follow-up telephone calls made three months after initial promotion. As in most of these sub-studies, the target subjects in these churches were those who had requested questionnaires, but had not returned them. The churches were randomized to either the experimental (received phone calls) or control status in a 2:1 ratio favoring the intervention [5]. Black Art Incentive: In February through April 2004, an innovative incentive strategy included the promise of a free Black art poster to those who returned their questionnaires [9]. This pilot study was promoted especially during February 2004, Black History month, as celebration activities were already in place at most of the participating churches. The choice of two posters was displayed on the back page of the questionnaire, and members were encouraged to select one as a �thank you� if they returned their questionnaire within six weeks. In the first of such pilots, members had a choice of either a poster or the usual $10. In a second pilot, held soon after in different churches but in the same part of the country, members received both an art piece and $10 for completing and returning their questionnaire promptly. b) Later Re-approach strategies Operation Mission Possible 30,000: From April until September 2005, with 37,000 surveys distributed to Black members 19,000 had not returned their questionnaires. Thus, we launched �Operation Mission Possible 30,000� to both Black and non-Black potential study members who had received a questionnaire at an earlier time. Operation 30,000 was developed with the intention of encouraging a total of 30,000 questionnaires returns and of that 20,000 of these we hoped would come from Black subjects. During this time we attempted to call 615 church recruiters; unfortunately we were not able to reach all 615. For those churches whose recruiters we could not reach by phone we contacted their pastors. We reached nearly half (253) and sent 209 packets to the churches, containing 7 simple strategies they could use to get their members to complete their questionnaires and return them. Some of the suggested strategies included a tag team approach whereby one member completes his questionnaire and then finds and encourages another member to also complete his/her questionnaire. Church members continue to tag each other this way until many members complete the questionnaires. We also encouraged the buddy system whereby enrolled church members paired up with another church member to complete their questionnaires together, thereby motivating each other to not give up until the questionnaire was completed and mailed. This strategy/method was instituted in all regions of the U.S. except Allegheny East (New Jersey, Delaware and contiguous eastern portions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia), Florida, and South Central (southeastern states including Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee) where initial promotion was within six months or had not yet begun.

Operation 30,000 will have affected intervention and control churches equally and should have caused no bias. **The apparent overlap in time between the $2/$10 sub-study with Local recruiters is only of trivial magnitude as the $2/$10 was not church- but individual subject-based. It affected only 1000 randomly selected subjects out of 80,000 enrolled, and affected equally both control and intervention churches of other sub-studies. Student recruiters Between 2002 and 2006, fifteen students from Oakwood College/University, Huntsville, Alabama and Loma Linda University, Southern California (Adventist tertiary educational institutions) visited 23 churches in California, New York (not in analytic data due to difficulty finding appropriate control churches), Florida, and Tennessee and made presentations and phone calls to encourage questionnaire returns. Students also promoted AHS-2 at their home churches when on school breaks. Some students attended large national church conferences, regional camp meetings and university alumni weekends, where they manned AHS-2 recruitment booths. Students received $20 for each returned questionnaire that was labeled with their assigned bar code number. Local recruiters Re-promotion In some cases, this local recruiter was the original lay church recruiter from the basic recruitment model, but in most cases it was someone new. Pastors were not directly involved, but if the extra efforts helped the church to reach its goal, this increased the pastors� monetary incentives. In most churches, local recruiters individually contacted members who had received a questionnaire, encouraged questionnaire completion and conducted group sessions to assist church members with completing their questionnaires. The local recruiter received $10 for each of the first five returned questionnaires and $20 for each returned after the first five. Tournament of healing Allegheny East Conference was selected for a pilot program that involved a spirited competition among churches which had completed enrollment one to two years previously. Churches were divided to three categories (small, medium, and large) and within each category churches competed for the most questionnaire returns. The winning churches were promised Bibles, engraved with the church�s name. The two criteria for selecting the competing churches were that the initial return rate was below 50% of the church�s goal, and that the pastors gave consent. Nine small, 13 medium-size, and 16 large churches were selected to participate. As a motivational tool, each church, and only that church was able to �heal� a specific cold symptom of a hypothetical �very sick clerk� at the AHS-2 headquarters, by achieving their church enrollment goal. We mailed to each church a chart of symptoms as goal points for healing. Local church recruiters were the main motivators over a period of three months. Operation lake region In 80 churches of the Lake Region Conference (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) we tested whether doubling the church members� monetary incentive from $10 to $20 would improve questionnaire returns. First our research assistants telephoned all 51 pastors, hoping for their support, and explaining this last chance to achieve their church goal so maximizing their monetary incentive. If the pastor could not be contacted by phone, they were sent a certified letter requiring a signature of receipt. Then, all 1,614 members in the 80 churches who had not returned their questionnaire were sent a letter explaining that their monetary thank you gift would double from $10 to $20 upon the return of their questionnaire. Incentives to enroll another member: $2 immediately or $10 late These sub-studies tested the willingness and ability of church members who had already returned their questionnaires, to use their enthusiasm to persuade others who had not completed their questionnaire to do so. Two different monetary incentives were tested for the enrollers, who were already members of AHS-2. For the $2 �up-front� incentive we randomly selected 500 potential enrollers who had already returned a questionnaire, and sent them a brand-new, crisp $2 bill, a thank you letter, and a questionnaire to give to a friend, church member, or family member to complete. For the $10 �after questionnaire return� incentive, another randomly selected 500 participating church members were sent the same request, but were promised that they would receive a $10 incentive upon our receipt of the enclosed questionnaire completed by a newly enrolled member. Statistical methods and selection of controls Churches received individual goals for the number of returned questionnaires. Membership rosters were often inaccurate so these goals were determined as 50% of the number of bulletins printed for the weekly church services, as this number approximately matched the number who regularly attended at that time. The measure of effect used for all sub-studies is the proportional increment, defined as (increment in returns during the sub-study intervention period)/Goal. The analyses for the two �Enroll Another� sub-studies are described separately below. The other sub-studies used church as the unit of observation and analysis. Details of control selection for the telephone follow-up and art poster sub-studies have been published [5,9]. However, these whole studies were published in more details in the previous publications than they are explained here. We describe all study endeavors in this one paper so that readers can understand the context of each sub-study and make informed comparisons. Thus the design and results of these two studies are also summarized here. More details are found in the original reports. With the large number of churches involved, we were able to find suitable control churches to allow a useful comparison, where necessary. Intervention and control periods were always defined as the 6 months after the intervention or defined control status began, and questionnaires that were returned in that period from churches or members, were counted. It was also required that these churches had not participated in other special promotions in the 6 month period before the study of interest began, to avoid contamination from other interventions. Controls were of two main types: a) churches acted as their own controls during an adjacent 6 month time period when there was no intervention; or b) Other churches that were matched by size, geographical region and time period, acted as controls. In the first situation we were aware that the underlying rate of return of questionnaires in a control period was gradually diminishing as time passed after the main enrollment promotion in a particular region. Thus a control period that followed the intervention period could give a non-conservative bias. Thus we either: a) took control periods for some churches before and other churches after the intervention period. Where the earlier and later periods involved different numbers of churches, the likelihood for the later control periods was weighted by the ratio a/b where a is the number of churches in the early and b in the later periods, as a means of restoring balance; b) took the average for each church of two control periods, that immediately before and immediately after the intervention period, where there were no other interventions in these control periods. The model used for statistical analysis, for all except the two �Enroll Another� sub-studies, assumed an over-dispersed Poisson process governing the returns from churches. The returns were evaluated during intervention and control periods as a proportion of the predetermined goals given to each of the J churches. The Poisson parameter, ? (the increment in returns), was modeled as ?j=Gjexp?+?1Ij+?j=1J?2jCj+ej where G is the goal for church j, I is intervention status (0?=?control; 1?=?intervention), the Cj are 0/1 variables indicating, in different sub-studies, either church identity or group identity (of a matched set of churches), and e is a Poisson error. Thus ?j/Gj is the proportional increment (PI) predicted by the model, and ? 1 is the coefficient of interest that indicates whether the intervention made a detectable difference. A p value tests the null hypothesis that ? 1 ?=?0, which is equivalent to testing that E (PII)?=?E (PIC), where subscripts I and C refer to intervention and control. The ? 2j coefficients are used, where necessary, to extract a component of variance due to individual churches or matched groups of churches, in a repeated measures approach. Coefficients were estimated by maximizing the likelihood, programming in the R language. An over-dispersion parameter was calculated [10] and used to adjust the z score used to test hypotheses. This accounts for the fact that churches are not identical units (aside from random error), even conditional on covariates (where these were included). The two �Enroll Another� sub-studies considered the 500 selected members as the units of observation, with the understanding that any returns from the additional questionnaires that they were each supplied was an increment that could only result from the intervention. Thus, there are no control groups. The statistic of interest is (number of returns during the sub-study)/750 and its 95% confidence interval, treated as a proportional increment. At the time of these sub-studies we were at about 2/3 of the study goal for the whole cohort. So if the interventions had been applied to all current respondents in the cohort, the denominator of the effect statistic (i.e. the goal) would have been 50% larger than the number of current participants. We proportionately apply the same reasoning to the 500 subjects actually in these sub-studies, so providing a value for G and a metric that can be compared to PI values from other sub-studies that were based on church as the unit of observation. Equivalently one could think of these 500 subjects as a synthetic church that was at 2/3 of its goal of 750 returns. The observations are treated as 500 independent Bernoulli outcomes, and the analyses use logistic models having only a constant term. The resulting predicted proportions of returns were multiplied by 2/3 to change the denominator to the sub-study goal. The alpha coefficient, its standard error, and the confidence interval for PII were all also adjusted appropriately. Table  2 summarizes the control selection and analytic strategies for each study.

Results Table  3 shows the results from the various sub-studies. The studies are divided into time periods ranging from the �being part of the initial promotion� to �9-36 months following initial promotion�, as it is clear that the challenge of promoting questionnaire returns becomes harder as time passes. Non-participating subjects have already rejected previous approaches.

The first, which was the most effective sub-study, was the use of Black art posters [9] as part of the initial promotion. When compared to $10 alone, the combination Black art plus $10 appeared to increase the proportional increment by 0.296, whereas Black art alone was not clearly better than the $10 incentive. The second sub-study used follow-up phone calls immediately after the initial promotion and involved most regions of the country. This resulted in nearly 800 additional questionnaire returns, and a difference in proportional increments of 0.063. These were in effect late returns to the initial promotion prompted by the phone calls. We found no advantage to such calling in a similar study among Whites [5]. Nine to 36 months after initial promotion at mid- to late-post-baseline, five other controlled sub-studies typically found that during the control periods, returns as a proportion of goal during a 6 month study period were very low (around 1-3%). Focusing on the difference between E (PII) and E (PIC) as the measure of effect, Operation 30,000 appears to be the least effective and the effect was not statistically significant. All other controlled sub-studies had a statistically significant effect. The magnitude of the significant effects ranged between 0.014 to 0.040. These modest, but apparently real effects, if they had been applied to the whole study independently would thus have individually produced 490 to 1400 additional returned questionnaires. The Tournament of Healing, a competition, appeared to be the most successful. The two �Enroll Another� studies did not need a control group as the control status of zero returns was reasonably assumed. They involved subjects who had already returned a questionnaire as the promoters, and occurred relatively late in the post-baseline period. In response to the Enroll Another $2 and $10 monetary sub-studies, there were 0.036 (95% confidence interval 0.025-0.052) and 0.027 (95% confidence interval 0.017-0.041) returns as a proportion of goal. Thus, these very late post-baseline strategies, that often may have followed previous strategies in some churches, had small effects that if applied to all cohort members who had already returned a questionnaire, would have been predicted to produce 1260 and 945 returns, respectively. However, in this case the $2 �Up-Front� would have been very expensive, around $37 per returned questionnaire. Discussion We believe that collectively these sub-studies/methods resulted in the return of nearly 3,000 additional questionnaires, even though they were often applied only to small sub-samples and at different times post-baseline. Clearly some approaches were more successful than others, though this was greatly dependent on timing after initial promotion. Some of these strategies were also applied in churches aside than those used for these analyses. These other churches were excluded from analyses because either more than one strategy was employed within the same time period, or we could not find a suitable control church or control period for them (see Table  1 for timing of sub-studies and any overlap). The most successful strategies The difference in proportional increments was greatest for the Black Art project as an enhancement of the initial promotion strategy [9]. We selected Black art as a culturally appropriate, appealing, and meaningful incentive to the target population, and its success is consistent with other findings [2-4]. The idea of using Black art had a very positive reception from church recruiters at an earlier training session, and we decided to test it mainly during February (Black History month). It thus seems possible that enrollment could have been 67% higher (30% of goal), given the time and resources to implement this strategy across the cohort. The Follow-up Phone Calls sub-study [5] produced a higher incremental questionnaire response rate among Black participants relative to controls, when applied three months after the initial promotion had begun. Those participants with whom we actually spoke were more likely to return their questionnaire than those who received only a telephone voice message. This is consistent with other data showing that Black subjects are particularly responsive to personal appeals [8,11]. Although effective, these calls were moderately costly in terms of manpower and telephone charges, we did judge them to be cost-effective. As this sub-study was conducted early in the recruitment years, we continued to use follow-up phone calls (throughout initial promotion/recruitment and re-promotion) in all the Black churches in order to maximize response. Finally we believe that they resulted in more than 2,000 additional members returning their questionnaires. The Tournament of Healing proved quite successful in motivating members to return questionnaires. Our plan was to capitalize on the proven motivational nature of competitions [12] to improve questionnaire returns. As anticipated it reenergized church members in some (but not all) churches, and again raised enthusiasm for the study. Less successful strategies The less successful strategies were generally those used during re-promotion 2�3 years post-baseline, but still may if employed alone, have each produced an extra 1,000 returns (around 3% of goal). An exception is Operation 30,000 that did not appear to be effective. After three years of recruiting/promoting and re-promoting we believed that church members and pastors had become desensitized to hearing about the study and became less inclined to complete and return their questionnaires. However, if these strategies had been inexpensive, they may still have been worthwhile, resulting in 200�600 additional completed questionnaires. However, in our view the costs of applying any of these to the whole cohort would not be justified by the likely response. Many of the sub-studies were conducted at a time when we were well through the recruitment period so their widespread implementation was not an issue unless effectiveness had been outstanding. The student and local recruiter strategies are relatively expensive as many recruiters need to be trained in order to cover hundreds of churches. Offering $20 per returned questionnaire would cost only $10 extra per questionnaire, but appeared to have only a small effect."
Breast_Cancer "The cost effectiveness of the strategies We did not collect data that allow detailed cost-effectiveness analysis. However, it is clear that the Black Art project at relatively little cost prompted an outstanding response. The Telephone Follow-Up and Tournament of Healing also delivered modest but worthwhile responses, again at a manageable cost. Responses in other sub-studies were lower. It should be noted that a 1% increment after the conclusion of the initial promotion would amount to about 230 additional questionnaires. The �Enroll Another� strategies would become expensive when applied to the whole cohort as they require a questionnaire to be mailed to all current respondents, for only a small proportionate return. We do not know whether some of these results would have been different if offered early in the recruitment strategy or even initially. Various types of controls were used in the different sub-studies that were dictated by the timing and flow of events in the main cohort study. While randomized controls are usually the best option, using the same church as its own control should also control many confounding factors. Even when other churches, matched as possible, were used, the over-dispersed Poisson analyses should largely compensate for other non-systematic differences between intervention and control churches. The use of multiple strategies Since Blacks in general are reluctant to participate in research for multiple reasons [2-4,8], it is logical to propose that multiple strategies with emphasis on flexibility would be advantageous to gain the cooperation of a large sample of Black participants [1,13]. In support of this Williams and associates [14] found an advantage to using multiple strategies, as some recruitment methods were effective in one community, but not in others; thus they found it necessary to make changes quickly, and implement new methods when the standard methods lost effectiveness, as did we. Others reported that in order to overcome the difficulties and barriers in recruiting Blacks to research studies, not only were multiple strategies needed [4,8,15-17], but appropriate incentives were imperative, noting that a lack of incentives may actually hinder Blacks from participating. Dickert and Grady [18] also discovered the motivating value of monetary incentives. Previous focus group results [4] in Adventists had also clearly indicated that they were likely to be important. It was interesting that we find that doubling the incentive from $10 to $20 late in the recruitment period had only a small effect. Conclusion As expected, recruitment methods used early proved more successful as compared to those used later in promotions. An apparently highly effective additional incentive during the initial promotion (the Black art) emphasized cultural sensitivity [4,8,13,17,19] rather than additional cash. The successful telephone follow-up early after the initial promotion emphasized the personal contact [8,11]. A somewhat later, but successful strategy, emphasized competition between churches for a reward tailored to the competitors (Bibles for the winning church). Other strategies were less successful, although it is possible that for some it was because they were employed long after the initial promotion. Nevertheless, most strategies appeared to increase response in a modest way. These results suggest to us that if we were to promote again in this population we would, in addition to using the successful initial promotion strategy [8]: a) Add the Black Art offer to the initial promotion; b) Add the follow-up phone call to encourage the slower respondents to respond to the initial promotion strategy; c) Consider the use of competitions between groups of churches, perhaps as part of the initial strategy (although tested here as a later strategy). We hope that others interested in recruiting Blacks to research studies can learn from our experiences and build on the lessons learned from this study. More formal and randomized controls in future work, perhaps particularly directed toward the Black Art strategy, would provide even stronger results. Further research is needed to examine whether our findings apply to the recruitment of Blacks in general, and to church congregations of other denominations.

C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is known to regulate lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer stem cells. In breast cancer, CXCR4 signalling has been reported to be a mediator of metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. However its role in normal and malignant breast stem cell function has not been investigated. Anoikis resistant (AR) cells were collected from immortalised (MCF10A, 226L) and malignant (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3) breast cell lines and assessed for stem cell enrichment versus unsorted cells. AR cells had significantly higher mammosphere forming efficiency (MFE) than unsorted cells. The AR normal cells demonstrated increased formation of 3D structures in Matrigel compared to unsorted cells. In vivo, SKBR3 and T47D AR cells had 7- and 130-fold enrichments for tumour formation respectively, compared with unsorted cells. AR cells contained significantly elevated CXCR4 transcript and protein levels compared to unsorted cells. Importantly, CXCR4 mRNA was higher in stem cell-enriched CD44+ /CD24? - patient-derived breast cancer cells compared to non-enriched cells. CXCR4 stimulation by its ligand SDF-1 reduced MFE of the normal breast cells lines but increased the MFE in T47D and patient-derived breast cancer cells. CXCR4 inhibition by AMD3100 increased stem cell activity but reduced the self-renewal capacity of the malignant breast cell line T47D. CXCR4 + FACS sorted MCF7 cells demonstrated a significantly increased MFE compared with CXCR4- cells. This significant increase in MFE was further demonstrated in CXCR4 over-expressing MCF7 cells which also had an increase in self-renewal compared to parental cells. A greater reduction in self-renewal following CXCR4 inhibition in the CXCR4 over-expressing cells compared with parental cells was also observed. Our data establish for the first time that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. Here, we demonstrate that CXCR4 signalling specifically regulates breast cancer stem cell activities and may therefore be important in tumour formation at the sites of metastases. CXCR4 stem cells breast cancer mammospheres AMD3100 SDF-1 INTRODUCTION The requirement of the breast to undergo the high level of proliferation observed during puberty and each round of pregnancy suggests the presence of a stem cell population within the breast [1]. Unequivocal evidence for the presence of stem cells in the murine mammary gland has been reported from a variety of studies [2-4]. There is evidence that a population of cells within breast cancer display stem cell properties Al-Hajj et al. [5]. In a clinical study, Li et al. [6] demonstrated enrichment of the breast cancer stem cell population (identified by flow cytometry and mammosphere assay in vitro) in response to chemotherapy. Many groups have enriched for functional breast cancer stem cells using ESA+/CD44+/CD24?/low [7-10]. In addition, mammosphere culture has been used to assess both normal and cancer stem cell activity. Recent evidence suggests that the mammosphere assay acts an accurate in vitro tumour model, particularly of aggressive tumours [11, 12]. Dontu et al. [13] utilised this assay to enrich for breast stem cells by harvesting mammospheres formed from cells which survived non-adherent culture conditions, the anoikis-resistant cells. Harrison et al. [10] reported that anoikis resistant cells had increased CD44+/CD24? expression and could be used to enrich for breast cancer stem cells. CXCR4 is the most common chemokine receptor expressed on tumour cells and has been detected in 23 different types of cancer [14, 15]. CXCR4 signalling has been linked with aggressiveness and the promotion of metastasis, with cells expressing the receptor homing to tissues secreting SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1). Muller et al. [16] and others have demonstrated that CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling in vivo regulates breast cancer metastases [17-22]. CXCR4 expression has been detected in the stem cell population of lung, pancreatic and prostate tumours [23-25]. In the current study we used anoikis-resistance to enrich for normal and malignant breast stem cells. Stem cell enrichment was validated both in vitro and in vivo. CXCR4 expression was found to be up-regulated in the stem cell-enriched populations and we show that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. Signalling through CXCR4 is found to specifically regulate self-renewal of malignant stem cells which may account for its role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. RESULTS Anoikis resistance enriches for mammosphere-initiating, normal colony-forming and tumour-initiating cells Anoikis-resistant cells harvested after 12 hours in mammosphere culture from two normal breast cell lines demonstrated significant increases in mammosphere forming potential compared with unsorted monolayer cells (Figure 1A � 226L: 4.0-fold increase, p<0.001; MCF10a: 1.9-fold increase, p<0.001). The degree of stem cell enrichment was also assessed in vitro using 3D-Matrigel culture (Figures 1B and C). The anoikis-resistant cells formed significantly more structures than unsorted monolayer cells for both cell lines (226L: 2.4 fold increase, MCF10a: 1.5 fold increase, both p<0.001). This significant increase in structures formed was seen across all sizes except those greater than 300 ?m where the number of structures formed was too low to gain significance (data not shown). Figure 1 Normal and malignant stem cells are anoikis-resistant Anoikis-resistant (AR) cells were harvested from 2 normal (MCF10a and 226L) and 3 malignant (SKBR3, MCF7 and T47D) breast cell lines and demonstrated stem cell enrichment. AR cells from MCF10a and 226L cell lines formed more mammospheres (A) and 3D structures in Matrigel (B and C) compared with unsorted monolayer cells. AR cells from SKBR3, T47D and MCF7 cell lines formed more mammospheres (D) and formed tumours in vivo more efficiently than their monolayer cells (E � SKBR3 and T47D only). Mammosphere results represent 3 independent experiments in triplicate (A and D). Matrigel results represent 2 independent experiments in quadruplicate (B). The numbers beside each data point represent the number of mice tested with each amount of cells (E). MFE � mammosphere forming efficiency, Mono � monolayer cells, AR � 12 hour anoikis-resistant cells. Scale bar (C) 100?m, error bars � S.E.M., ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001. Twelve hour anoikis-resistant cells from the 3 malignant cell lines, MCF7, SKBR3 and T47D also demonstrated a significant increase in the number of mammospheres formed compared with monolayer cells (Figure 1D � MCF7: 1.8-fold increase, p<0.001; T47D: 2.7-fold increase, p<0.001; SKBR3: 2.3-fold increase, p<0.01). Previous work by Harrison et al. [10] demonstrated that the anoikis-resistant population of MCF7 cells is enriched for stem cells both in vitro and in vivo (5.7-fold and 12-fold respectively). However, until now, no studies have demonstrated the tumorigenic potential of the anoikis-resistant population of T47D or SKBR3 cell lines in vivo. We therefore injected limiting dilutions of T47D or SKBR3 cells into immunocompromised mice to investigate the tumour initiating capacity of the anoikis-resistant cells versus monolayer cells. It can clearly be seen that anoikis-resistant cells form tumours more efficiently than monolayer cells (Figure 1E � fold change at 50% tumour formation, T47D: 130-fold increase and SKBR3: 7-fold increase). Analysis of gene expression in anoikis-resistant cells reveals up-regulation of CXCR4 in normal and malignant breast cell lines Changes in gene expression between the populations of anoikis-resistant cells (collected after 8 or 12 hours in mammosphere culture) and monolayer cells for the five cell lines were analysed using an Agilent custom microarray. We identified genes which were differentially expressed between monolayer and the 2 anoikis-resistant cell populations. Initial analysis revealed no significant differences between the 8 and 12 hour anoikis-resistant cells in both the normal and malignant cell lines. However, there were more genes differentially expressed between 12 hour anoikis-resistant cells (compared to monolayer) than between 8 hour anoikis-resistant cells (compared to monolayer) supporting the hypothesis that greater stem cell-enrichment is achieved after 12 hours in mammosphere culture (data not shown). Fewer genes were differentially expressed between the anoikis-resistant and monolayer populations of the normal cell lines compared with the malignant cell lines. Figure 2A shows genes which had a greater than 2-fold difference in expression between monolayer and anoikis-resistant populations. Several of these genes have previously been associated with stem cell functions: MAFB and ZNF589 have been shown to be important in lineage-specific haematopoiesis [26, 27], while HES4 is a down-stream target of the Notch signalling pathway which has been shown to affect breast cancer stem cell activity [10]. CXCR4 has previously been shown to be important in metastasis of breast cancer and is highly expressed in the cancer stem cell population of other epithelial cancers [23-25]. We therefore chose to focus our attention on the expression and role of CXCR4 signalling in normal and malignant breast stem cells. Figure 2 CXCR4 RNA and protein expression is increased in anoikis-resistant cells Gene expression of the anoikis-resistant fraction versus monolayer cells of 2 normal (MCF10a and 226L) and 3 malignant (SKBR3, MCF7 and T47D) breast cell lines were analysed using an Agilent custom microarray. 12 genes increased >2-fold expression in the anoikis-resistant population versus monolayer cells while 3 genes significantly decreased >2-fold expression averaging expression across all cell lines (A). Quantitative RT-PCR and FACS confirmed increased gene and cell surface expression of CXCR4 in 4 out of the 5 cell lines analysed compared with monolayer cells (B and C). CXCR4 transcript levels were also found to be significantly higher in CD44+/CD24? flow sorted cells from Creighton et al. 2009 [28] (D). Pearson correlation was used for hierarchical clustering of gene expression (rows), red = high and blue = low relative to mean (white), grey = no expression. Mono � monolayer cells, AR � 12 hour anoikis-resistant cells, n.d. � not detectable. FACS plots representative of 3 independent experiments, (D) n = 14, error bars � S.E.M., ** p<0.01. The gene expression levels of CXCR4 in the 12 hour anoikis-resistant and monolayer cells were validated by qPCR, while flow cytometry was used to assess CXCR4 cell surface expression. An increase in CXCR4 transcripts were observed in the anoikis-resistant cells compared with the monolayer cells for 4 out of the 5 breast cell lines (Figure 2B). CXCR4 expression was too low to be detected in either population of 226L cells. Both normal cell lines showed low levels of cell surface expression of CXCR4 in monolayer (226L � 0.44%, MCF10a � 0.30%). The expression of CXCR4 remained low, but significantly increased in the anoikis-resistant cell population for both cell lines (226L � 3.6-fold increase, n=3, p<0.001; MCF10a � 3.0-fold increase, n=3, p<0.05). Cell surface expression of CXCR4 was significantly increased in the anoikis-resistant cell populations of T47D (5.3-fold change, n=3, p<0.05) and SKBR3 (2.9-fold change, n=3, p<0.05). However, there was a significant decrease in cell surface expression of CXCR4 in the anoikis-resistant cell population of the malignant cell line which expressed the most CXCR4 in monolayer, MCF7 cells (12.1% in monolayer, 0.5-fold change in anoikis-resistant population, n=3, p<0.05). MCF7 anoikis-resistant cells were the only cell line to decrease in cell surface expression (Figure 2C). "
Breast_Cancer "To obtain supporting data from patient tumours, we obtained CXCR4 transcript levels from Creighton et al. [28] where breast cancer stem cell-enriched populations (CD44+/CD24?) were sorted by flow cytometry and gene expression was analysed (Figure 2D). The data show an average 6-fold higher CXCR4 expression in patient-derived breast cancer stem cells (n=14, p<0.01). Effects of stimulation and inhibition of CXCR4 on mammosphere-formation/self-renewal of cell lines and patient-derived tumours To examine the effects of CXCR4 signalling on stem cell activity, the CXCR4 ligand, SDF-1 and the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 were used to stimulate or inhibit signalling respectively, either alone, or in combination (Figure 3). Mammosphere forming efficiency (MFE) was significantly reduced with the addition of SDF-1 (p<0.001) whereas AMD3100 had no effect on either of the immortalised normal breast cell lines. However, addition of the antagonist in combination with SDF-1 rescued the reduction seen with SDF-1 treatment alone and increased the MFE of both cell lines back to control levels (Figure 3A, p<0.001 for both). Figure 3 Inhibition and stimulation of CXCR4 signalling has differing effects on stem cell activity of normal and malignant breast cell lines and patient-derived cells SDF-1 and AMD3100 was used to stimulate and inhibit CXCR4 signalling respectively in the mammosphere assay. Stimulation of CXCR4 signalling reduced the number of mammospheres formed in the normal breast cell lines MCF10a and 226L while it increased mammosphere formation in the malignant cell line T47D and cells derived from patients with breast cancer (A). Combination treatment with SDF-1 and AMD3100 increased mammosphere formation in both MCF7 and T47D cell lines but had no effect on SKBR3 cells. Treatment with AMD3100 reduced stem cell self-renewal of T47D cells (B). SDF-1 treatment increased self-renewal of the single patient derived sample tested for 2nd generation mammosphere formation. Both treatments had no significant effects on self-renewal of 226L cells. 1st generation mammosphere results (A) represent 3 independent results in triplicate. 226L and T47D 2nd generation mammosphere results represent 3 independent results. Patient-derived cells were obtained from 2 ascites samples and primary established cell line (from an ascites). All statistics are comparing mammosphere formation against untreated controls (far left bar of each chart). MFE � mammosphere forming efficiency, error bars � S.E.M., * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001. Two human ascites samples taken from patients with breast cancer were also treated with AMD3100 and SDF-1, along with a cell line originally established from a primary ascites sample. SDF-1 treatment alone significantly increased MFE (p<0.01) while AMD3100 alone had no effect (Figure 3A). Combination treatment reduced MFE back to the level of untreated samples (p<0.01). Single and combination treatment of AMD3100 and SDF-1 in mammosphere culture was repeated with the 3 malignant cell lines MCF7, T47D and SKBR3 (Figure 3A). Only the MFE of the T47D cell line was significantly increased in response to AMD3100 (p<0.05). SDF-1 treatment alone increased MFE in both MCF7 and T47D cell lines, but again, significance was only reached in the T47D cell line (p<0.001). Interestingly, combination treatment of AMD3100 and SDF-1 to MCF7 and T47D cells in mammosphere culture significantly increased MFE further compared with no treatment (MCF7 � p<0.01, T47D � p<0.001). AMD3100 or SDF-1 alone or combination had no effect on the MFE of the ER negative cell line, SKBR3. Differences in the response of patient-derived samples to SDF-1 compared to the cell lines is likely due to high endogenous cytokine levels in the fluid (Mean 5413.3pg/ml) from which the cells were obtained. In contrast, there was 7-fold less SDF-1 present in T47D cell line-conditioned medium and several hundred-fold lower levels in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells (Table 1). Thus, control MFE may represent an SDF-1 withdrawal response while treatment may represent maintenance of cytokine exposure. Table 1 An ELISA was used to measure SDF-1 concentrations in the metastatic fluid collected from human patient derived ascites samples and from the media of cell lines grown in culture for 3 days Fold change for each cell line was calculated versus the mean SDF-1 concentration from the 3 ascites samples. N.d. � not detected, means calculated from 3 individual samples in duplicate. Fold change vs. ascites Sample Mean SDF-1 concentration (pg/ml) Human patient-derived ascites 5413.3 x 7 T47D 767.5 x 159 MCF7 34.0 x 381 SKBR3 14.2 x 588 226L 9.2 x ? MCF10a n.d. First generation mammospheres from 226L, T47D cells and one of the ascites samples were dissociated and re-plated into a mammosphere assay in the absence of secondary treatment to assess the effects of first generation treatment on stem cell self-renewal (Figure 3B). A small increase in self-renewal was seen with single treatments of SDF-1 or AMD3100 for the 226L cell line while T47D cells had a marked decrease in self-renewal of mammospheres treated with AMD3100 (both alone and in combination with SDF-1) during second generation culture (p<0.01), while SDF-1 had no effect on self-renewal. For the ascites sample, first generation cells treated with SDF-1 alone showed an increase in self-renewal. This was reduced when AMD3100 was added in combination with SDF-1, while AMD3100 treatment alone had no effect. Mammosphere formation/self-renewal in FACS-sorted CXCR4-positive and negative populations treated with SDF-1 and AMD3100 In an attempt to further resolve the effects of CXCR4 on stem cell activity, cells positive for surface expression of CXCR4 were sorted using FACS. The MCF7 cell line was chosen due to its high CXCR4 expression. Both positive and negative fractions were collected and purity checks performed (Figures 4a and data not shown). Figure 4 Effects of inhibition and stimulation of CXCR4 signalling on stem cell activity of CXCR4 sorted MCF7 cells MCF7 cells were sorted for cell surface expression of CXCR4 (A). CXCR4 positive cells demonstrated increased mammosphere formation compared with CXCR4 negative cells (B). Inhibition of CXCR4 signalling using AMD3100 reduced stem cell activity of CXCR4 positive cells while it had little effect on 1st generation CXCR4 negative cells (C). CXCR4 positive and negative cells showed similar results for 2nd generation mammosphere formation (D). No further treatment was added to 2nd generation mammosphere cultures. 1st generation mammosphere results (B and C) represent 3 independent results in triplicate. 2nd generation mammosphere results represent 3 independent results. All statistics are comparing mammosphere formation against untreated controls (far left bar of each chart). MFE � mammosphere forming efficiency, error bars � 1 S.E.M., * p<0.05, ** p<0.01. CXCR4 positive FACS cells had higher MFE than CXCR4 negative cells (p < 0.05, Figure 4B). The CXCR4 negative cells showed little change in MFE in response to SDF-1 or AMD3100 treatment (Figure 4C) while the first generation MFE of the CXCR4 positive fraction of MCF7 cells mimicked the response of secondary generation unsorted T47D cells, with AMD3100 significantly reducing the MFE independent of SDF-1 treatment (AMD3100 alone; p<0.01, combination; p<0.05). Second generation data for the negative CXCR4 fraction demonstrated a significant decrease in MFE in response to AMD3100 primary treatment alone and in combination with SDF-1 (Figure 4D). A decrease was seen for the same treatment conditions in the positive CXCR4 fraction however this did not reach significance. Neither population showed any effect of primary SDF-1 treatment on second generation MFE. CXCR4 over-expression induces mammosphere formation/self-renewal and is inhibited by AMD3100 In order to further investigate CXCR4 signalling in malignant cells, CXCR4 was retrovirally over-expressed in MCF7 cells using human codon optimised CXCR4 cDNA. FACS was used to verify a 5.9 fold increase in CXCR4 compared with the empty vector control (83.3% vs. 14.2%, Figure 5A). Figure 5 Effects of inhibition and stimulation of CXCR4 signalling on stem cell activity of CXCR4 over-expressing MCF7 cells Cell surface expression of CXCR4 increased 5.9-fold after retroviral infection with human codon optimised CXCR4 cDNA (A). Over-expression of CXCR4 increased both stem cell activity and self-renewal of MCF7 cells in the mammosphere assay (B). MCF7 cells over-expressing CXCR4 showed sensitisation to the effects of CXCR4 inhibition by AMD3100 causing both a reduction in stem cell activity (C) and self-renewal (D). A proposed model for CXCR4 signalling in normal and malignant breast stem cells is shown in (E); Stimulation of CXCR4 signalling decreases stem cell activity in normal breast stem cells. The opposite effect occurs in malignant breast stem cells while also increasing stem cell self-renewal. Inhibition of CXCR4 signalling has no measurable effect on normal stem cells but reduces malignant stem cell self-renewal. No further treatment was added to 2nd generation mammosphere cultures. 1st generation mammosphere results (B and C) represent 3 independent results in triplicate. 2nd generation mammosphere results represent 3 independent results. All statistics are comparing mammosphere formation against untreated controls. MFE � mammosphere forming efficiency, error bars � 1 S.E.M., * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001. Over-expression of CXCR4 significantly increased (p<0.001) the mammosphere forming potential of MCF7 cells compared with empty vector control (Figure 5B), correlating with the data from the CXCR4 sort (Figure 4B). Second generation mammosphere culture demonstrated that over-expressing CXCR4 significantly increases self-renewal of MCF7 cells (p<0.001; Figure 5B). SDF-1 treatment alone or in combination with AMD3100 significantly increased the first generation MFE of the empty vector control cells (both p<0.01; Figure 5C), as previously seen with parental MCF7 cells. Addition of AMD3100 significantly reduced the MFE of the CXCR4 over-expressing cells (p<0.001) with combination treatment of AMD3100 and SDF-1 also showing a significant reduction (p<0.05). The effects of CXCR4 over-expression on self-renewal were then investigated using the primary mammospheres formed after treatment with AMD3100 and SDF-1 (Figure 5D). Second generation mammosphere forming capacities of the empty vector control cells showed no difference across all treatment groups. In the CXCR4 over-expressing cells, the second generation mammosphere forming efficiency was significantly reduced in both AMD3100 treatment groups (both p<0.001). SDF-1 treatment had no effect on the secondary MFE of the CXCR4 over-expressing cells. DISCUSSION In this study we utilised early mammosphere culture to harvest the anoikis-resistant population of immortalised normal and malignant breast cell lines. The anoikis-resistant fraction of the malignant cell line MCF7 has previously been demonstrated to be enriched for cancer stem cells [10]. We confirmed this previous finding by showing that anoikis-resistant cells can enrich for stem cells in the normal breast cell lines MCF10a and 226L and the malignant breast cell lines T47D and SKBR3. Normal stem cell enrichment was demonstrated using the clonogenic mammosphere and Matrigel assays in vitro. For the malignant cells, the mammosphere culture was used in vitro to confirm stem cell enrichment and limiting dilution assays in vivo to demonstrate increased tumour formation of the anoikis-resistant cells. A custom gene microarray highlighted several genes that were differentially expressed between the stem cell-enriched populations and unsorted monolayer cells across all the cell lines (TRIM16, FOS, HES4 and ID1). Of particular interest was the increase in gene expression of CXCR4 in both the normal and malignant stem cell enriched fractions. Signalling of this chemokine receptor, via its ligand SDF-1, has been linked with migration in normal development and metastasis in many types of cancer [19, 29, 30]. More recently, high CXCR4 expression has been demonstrated in prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer stem cells, but the full extent of its role in cancer has not been elucidated [23-25]. In breast cancer, high CXCR4 expression is found in aggressive tumours, correlating with poor prognosis and a decrease in disease-free survival [31-33]. As well as a mediator of metastasis, CXCR4 signalling has been found to contribute to breast tumour growth at the primary site; however its function in stem cell activity, both normal and malignant, has not yet been investigated [19, 21]. Our data demonstrated that stimulation of the CXCR4 pathway in the normal breast cell lines by SDF-1 decreased mammosphere formation but had no effect on normal stem cell self-renewal. Inhibition of the CXCR4 pathway in the ER+ malignant cell line T47D, resulted in a significant increase in stem cell activity but a reduction in stem cell self-renewal. However, stimulation of the CXCR4 pathway in human primary fluid samples from metastatic breast cancer patients increased both stem cell activity and self-renewal. MCF7 cells either sorted for CXCR4 expression or transfected to over-express CXCR4 demonstrated greater mammosphere forming potential compared with controls suggesting an increase in stem cell activity. CXCR4 over-expression or stimulation of CXCR4 signalling conferred an increase in the self-renewal capacity of malignant stem cells. This study is the first to explore the specific role of CXCR4 in normal and malignant breast stem cells. Our data is consistent with a model in which CXCR4 signalling produces contrasting effects in normal and malignant breast stem cells (Figure 5E). This could be due to the activation of different downstream targets. However, the effects on stem cell activity require further investigation and cannot be determined from the mammosphere assay alone. For example, the increase in stem cell activity observed in response to CXCR4 stimulation in malignant stem cells could result from an increase in proliferation, a release from senescence or an increase in anoikis resistance. Additional experimentation will be required to identify which of these functions is affected by CXCR4 signalling both in vitro and in vivo. The differences in the response of cells derived from human breast cancer and the malignant cells lines to AMD3100 and SDF-1 could be due to high levels of endogenous SDF-1 already present in the ascites fluid from which patient-derived samples were obtained (Table 1). Recent studies have demonstrated that CXCR7 can also heterodimerise with CXCR4, enhancing signalling via SDF-1 [34], adding complexity to the signalling pathway. The role of CXCR7 in cancer progression cannot be ignored, but distinguishing between the effects of CXCR4 and CXCR7 signalling will be difficult. Previous studies in pancreatic and prostate cancer stem cells also showed that stimulation of CXCR4 signalling increased the cancer stem cell fraction, [24, 25] while inhibition reduced stem cell activity (measured by the ability to form metastases). Efforts to investigated the engraftment potential of CXCR4 sorted (by FACS) human cord blood and foetal cells have shown that CXCR4 negative cells engraft equally well as CXCR4 positive cells [35, 36]. Kollet et al. investigated this further and found that blocking CXCR4 signalling in the CXCR4 negative fraction inhibited engraftment. However, sorting for CXCR4 also reduced the engraftment of CXCR4 positive cells compared with unsorted cells. Interestingly, they also demonstrated that engraftment and migration of both sorted CXCR4 populations could be enhanced through the addition of an assortment of cytokines (including IL-6 and G-CSF). Overall, they propose that cells have intracellular stores of CXCR4 which can be released rapidly in response to cytokines and that sorting for CXCR4 using monoclonal antibodies which bind to same domains as SDF-1 can interfere with CXCR4 signalling. They suggest that cells should be sorted for CXCR4 expression using alternate methods such as migration assays. A limitation with our predicted model is that it does not include the interaction of SDF-1 and its inhibitor with other receptors such as CXCR7 or the surrounding stroma which is responsible for the majority of SDF-1 secretion. The scavenging role of CXCR7 on SDF-1 may moderate CXCR4 signalling with high levels of expression of CXCR7 observed on many tumour cell lines and human primary tumour samples [37-39]. CXCR7 signalling has been demonstrated to increase cell proliferation and cellular adhesion suggesting that it may also function as a typical GPCR as well as a scavenging receptor, mediating the signal transduction process [37, 40, 41]. Whether these functional responses of CXCR7 observed are only via interaction with CXCR4 or are evidence of independent signalling are yet to be determined and requires further investigation. CONCLUSION CXCR4 is expressed in a broad range of normal and malignant tissues and demonstrates diverse functions. This can be explained by changes in the activation of different downstream signalling components dependent on cell type and location. Our data establish for the first time that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. CXCR4 influences self-renewal of malignant stem cells and is highly expressed in stem cell populations in patient tumours, which may account for its role in tumour progression and metastasis. The differing role of CXCR4 signalling on normal and malignant breast stem cells suggests potential in the use of CXCR4-targeted therapy alongside current standards of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient-derived breast cancer samples Three ascites samples were collected from patients with metastatic breast cancer following fully informed consent (Local research ethics committee number 05/Q1402/25). All three samples were from patients with luminal (ER+/PR+) tumours, two of which were grade 3 (one HER2+, one HER2-) and had received chemo- and endocrine-therapy. Mice All in vivo experiments utilised female athymic Nu/Nu (nude) mice obtained from Harlan laboratory. For experiments involving the estrogen receptor positive cell line T47D, estrogen pellets (17 ?-oestradiol 90-day slow release pellets; Innovative Research of America) were implanted into mice 7 days before injection of the cells. Mice were monitored daily and weighed every 3-4 days. Cell lines and cell culture MCF10a, MCF7 and T47D cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). 226L cells were derived by infecting human breast epithelial cells with amphotropic retrovirus transducing a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T-antigen using the catalytic subunit of telomerase [42, 43] and were a gift from Professor Mike O'Hare (Ludwig Institute, London). They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1 - Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 20ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 20ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 5?g/ml insulin and 1?g/ml hydrocortisone. SKBR3 cells were a gift from Dr Valarie Speirs (Leeds University, UK) and cultured in McCoy's 5A (Gibco) with 10% FBS. HEK293-T "
Breast_Cancer "fibroblast cells (derived from human kidney, ATCC) were used for production of virus and were a gift from Dr Akira Orimo (The University of Manchester, UK). MCF10a cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20ng/ml hEGF, 100ng/ml cholera toxin, 500ng/ml hydrocortisone and 10?g/ml insulin. MCF7, T47D and HEK293-T cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma), 10% FBS and 2mM L-glutamine. Levels of SDF-1 secreted into the media during 3 days of culture of cell lines were assayed for SDF-1 levels using a human CXCL12/SDF-1? Quantikine� ELISA, performed following the manufacturers protocol. All cells were incubated at 37�C and 5% humidified CO2 and were used in experiments when ~80% confluent. Cell lines were tested regularly for mycoplasma by PCR and discarded if positive. Primary cell extraction and culture Cells from ascites fluid were collected by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes at 4�C. The supernatant was collected and assayed for levels of SDF-1. The pellet was resuspended in cold PBS and red blood cells removed using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield). Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used to remove lymphocytes and purify the remaining cells. Mammosphere culture First and second generation mammosphere culture was performed following the previously published protocol [44]. All cell lines were plated out at a density of 500 viable cells/cm2 into mammosphere culture, except for MCF7 cells, which were plated out at a density of 300 viable cells/cm2. Mammospheres from primary samples were counted after 7 days in culture. AMD3100 (Sigma) and SDF-1 (Miltenyi) were added at time of plating into mammosphere culture at concentrations listed in each relevant figure. Media was not changed throughout the duration of the mammosphere culture. Harvesting anoikis-resistant cells Cells from each epithelial cell line were plated out according to the first generation mammosphere culture protocol. After 8 and 12 hours the media containing the anoikis-resistant cells was harvested and centrifuged at 580g for 2 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, the cell pellet washed twice in cold PBS and the dead cells removed using a dead cell removal kit in conjunction with MACS� sorting columns (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturers protocol (supplementary Figure 1). Matrigel culture Twelve hour anoikis-resistant 226L or MCF10a cells were collected as described above. Single cell suspensions of monolayer 226L or MCF10a cells were also harvested. 50?l of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was added to each well of a pre-chilled 8 well chamber slide and incubated at 37�C for 15 minutes to allow the basement membrane to solidify. Cells were resuspended in 2% Matrigel diluted in the respective monolayer media for each cell line, and 3000 cells plated out into each well in triplicate. Matrigel cultures were incubated at 37�C and 5% humidified CO2. Structures were scored after 21 days using a microscope fitted with a graticule. Limiting dilution assays in vivo Twelve hour anoikis-resistant cells were collected from SKBR3 and T47D cell lines and the dead cells removed. Viable cells were resuspended in 50% Matrigel (v/v with PBS) and injected subcutaneously into each flank of nude mice assessing tumour growth every 3-4 days, measured using callipers. Experiments were ended when tumour growth plateaued or total tumour volume exceeded 1.3cm3. Tumour volumes were calculated as (length � length � width) divided by 2. Measuring CXCR4 surface expression To analyse CXCR4 cell surface expression, fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was utilised. Single cell suspensions were centrifuged (580g for 2 minutes) and resuspended in cold PBS at ? 1 � 107 cells/ml containing UV live/dead dye (Invitrogen). CXCR4 PE-Cy�5 (BD Biosciences) was added and the cells were incubated at 4�C for 15 minutes. The cells were washed with cold PBS, centrifuged at 1800g for 2 minutes and resuspended in cold PBS ready for analysis. Fluorescence was measured using the LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo (version 7.6.5). Sorting for CXCR4 expression Staining of the cells for sorting followed the same protocol for analysis of surface CXCR4 expression except that the cells were resuspended in running buffer prior to sorting and a violet live/dead dye (Invitrogen) was used due to laser restrictions. Cells were sorted using the FACS Aria (Becton Dickinson) at 16 pounds per square inch (PSI) pressure and Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS) as sheath fluid. For each sort, a sample with only viable dye was run as a pressure control. RNA extraction RNA was collected from monolayer samples and anoikis-resistant cells harvested after 8 and 12 hours in mammosphere culture. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy� Plus Mini following the manufacturer's protocol, using a QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen) to homogenise the cell lysates. In addition to the gDNA eliminator spin column provided in the RNeasy kit, an on-column DNase digestion was performed to ensure maximum removal of DNA. The concentration of RNA was measured using a GeneQuant machine (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative real time (RT)-PCR Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine the levels of CXCR4 expression. For primer sequences see supplementary table 1. Samples were set up in triplicate, prepared using the EpMotion 5070 pipetting robot and analysed using the 7900 PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Data was analysed using the relative quantification method normalising sample CT values with 3 housekeeper genes and gene expression was calculated as 2???Ct Agilent gene custom microarray RNA integrity was assessed by microanalysis (Agilent Bioanalyser). RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation� Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN) following the manufacturers protocol which employs SPI� amplification. The cDNA generated was fluorescently labelled using the FL-Ovation� cDNA Fluorescent Module kit (NuGEN) with a single tag (Cy�3) (following manufacturers protocol). Custom microarray chips were purchased from Agilent using a web-based application to design the microarrays to our specifications. It was designed by selecting 7198 genes of interest and 4543 housekeeper genes. The genes of interest were selected on the basis of their implication in: stem cell maintenance, stem cell, proliferation and differentiation and cancer treatment resistance. The fluorescently tagged cDNA was loaded onto microarray slides and the Agilent microarray chips fastened carefully on top (8 chips to a slide). These were incubated at 65�C for 40 hours in a hybridisation oven to allow hybridisation to occur. The chips were scanned using an Agilent scanner. Gene expression analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA), further moderated by an empirical Bayes adjustment was used to analyse the Agilent gene expression data using SPSS (version 16.0). Heat maps were generated using GENE-E (version 1.0.397). Raw .cel files representing gene expression data of flow sorted cells from Creighton et al. [28] were downloaded from NCBI GEO (GSE7513), summarised with Ensembl alternative CDF [45] and normalised with RMA [46]. CXCR4 over-expression using retro-virus Packaging and envelope plasmids (pUMVC3-gag-pol and pCMV-VSVG ; Addgene plasmid 8449 and 8454) were expanded using Library Efficiency� DH5?� Competent Cells (Invitrogen) following the standard transformation procedure on L-broth agar plates supplemented with ampicillin [47]. Human codon-optimised CXCR4 cDNA [48] was cloned into the pBABE retroviral vector (pBABE-puro; Addgene plasmid 1764). Retro-virus particles were produced using the fibroblast cell line HEK293T. Transfection was performed after 24 hours using the FuGENE 6 kit following the manufacturer's protocol combining the packaging and envelope vectors with each construct. The media was changed 16 hours after transfection to standard HEK293T media. After 48 hours transfection, the media containing virus particles was collected and centrifuged at 900g for 10 minutes at 4�C to pellet any cells. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45?m filter to remove any remaining cells or debris. The virus was purified by layering onto a 20% sucrose cushion (v/v in PBS) and collected by ultracentrifugation at 33,735g for 3 hours at 4�C. MCF7 cells were infected with the virus 24 hours after plating by adding the virus to target cell media containing protamine sulphate (1:1000 - Sigma). Virus concentrations were determined by titration. Antibiotic selection of MCF7 infected cells was by puromycin (Invitrogen). Statistical analysis Parametric tests were used to test for significant differences as all the data was normally distributed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc comparisons was used when more than 2 groups were being assessed. Otherwise, unpaired t-tests were used for comparisons of 2 groups. Further statistical details about each experiment are stated in the figure legends. Each cell line was analysed separately unless stated. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 16.0).

Breast_Cancer " streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 at 37 �C. The cells reached confluence after three days and were used for the assays. Cell suspensions, 1 � 106 cells/ml in 6 ml of culture medium, were incubated with or without the experimental compounds in cell culture plates. The platinum(II) complexes [Pt2(L1)4B2, Pt2(L2)4B2, Pt2(L3)4B2, Pt2(L4)4B2, and Pt2(L5)4B2] and cisplatin were added to the cultured cells to give a final concentration 20 ?M. Control cells were incubated without test compounds. Cells from each cell line were harvested after 12 h of incubation. Lipid Peroxidation The extent of lipid peroxidation in cells was assayed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. MDA levels were estimated by performing a condensation reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) with MDA. The products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In brief, 0.75 ml phosphate acid solution (0.44 M) and 0.25 ml freshly prepared TBA solution (42 mM) were added to 0.5 ml diluted cells, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 100 �C. After the mixture cooled, 0.5 ml was neutralized with 0.5 ml 1 M methanol�1 M NaOH (45.5:4.5; v:v). After centrifugation, 30 ?l of the solution was injected into the chromatographic column (RP18). Separation was carried out with an isocratic elution of 40 % methanol and 60 % phosphate buffer pH 7.0. Detection was performed with a spectrofluorometric detector (?excitation = 532 nm; ?emission = 553 nm). The concentration of MDA was expressed in nmoles TBA-rs/ml in the cell lysates. Electrochemical Method In order to determine the surface charge density of cell membranes, cells were suspended in 0.015 M NaCl in a measuring vessel, and electrophoretic mobility was measured using Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus (Malvern Instruments). The measurements were carried out as a function of pH. The surface charge density was determined by the equation: ? = ?u/d in which u was the electrophoretic mobility, ? was the viscosity of the solution, and d was the diffuse layer thickness (Krysi?ski and Tien 1986). The diffuse layer thickness was determined from the formula (Barrow 1996) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$d = \sqrt {\frac{{\varepsilon \cdot \varepsilon_{0} \cdot R \cdot T}}{{2 \cdot F^{2} \cdot I}}}$$\end{document}, where R was the gas constant, T was the temperature, F was the Faraday number, I was the ionic strength of 0.9 % NaCl, and ??o was the permeability electric medium. Statistical Analysis The data obtained in this study were expressed as mean � SD. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Scheffe�s F test for multiple comparisons. The values for P < 0.05 were considered significant. Results and Discussion Chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of breast cancer, a leading cause of cancer death among women. This study was conducted to examine the effects of new chemotherapeutic complexes on the electrical properties and extent of lipid peroxidation in human breast cancer cells. The experimental and theoretical surface charge densities of the cell membrane measured as a function of pH are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. The experimental measurements were indicated by points, and the theoretical values were represented as curves. The surface charge density dependencies of MDA-MB and MCF-7 cells on pH produced similarly, shaped curves for all studies.Fig. 2The membrane charge density of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with and without treatment with cisplatin and Pt2(L1)4B2. The experimental values are marked by points and the theoretical ones by line Fig. 3The membrane charge density of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with and without treatment with cisplatin and Pt2(L5)4B2. The experimental values are marked by points and the theoretical ones by line Fig. 4The membrane charge density of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with and without treatment with cisplatin and Pt2(L1)4B2. The experimental values are marked by points and the theoretical ones by line The treatment of MDA-MB cells with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes caused a decrease in negative charge at high/low pH values compared with untreated cells (Figs. 2, 3). The isoelectric point of MDA-MB cell membranes treated with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes shifted to higher pH values compared with untreated MDA-MB cell membranes. Similarly, administering cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes to MCF-7 cells caused a decrease in negative charge at high pH values and an increase in positive charge at low pH values compared with untreated MCF-7 cells (Figs. 4, 5). The isoelectric point of cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complex treated MCF-7 cell membranes shifted to higher pH values compared with untreated MCF-7 cell membranes.Fig. 5The membrane charge density of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with and without treatment with cisplatin and Pt2(L5)4B2. The experimental values are marked by points and the theoretical ones by line Mathematical calculations based on the four equilibria model described the adsorption of electrolyte ions on a cell surface membrane. We used this to enable quantitative evaluations of the membrane parameters. The total concentrations of functional CTA and CTB groups was determined for treated and untreated breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB and MCF-7. The average association constants KAH and KBOH were calculated based on Eqs. 13 and 14. The CTA, CTB, KAH, and KBOH constants resulting from the calculations were substituted into Eq. 12 yielding the theoretical curve. Experimental points and theoretical curves are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. The theoretical and experimental surface charge density values agreed. The experimental results indicated that cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes caused a decrease in negative charge at the MDA-MB cell surface. This corresponded to a decreased surface concentration of CTA groups. Changes in functional group composition of the MDA-MB cell membrane can be due to the appearance or disappearance of new functional groups resulting from the reactions with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes. Treatment with cisplatin or novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes increased the association constants of negatively charged KAH and decreased the association constants of positively charged KBOH groups (Table 1).Table 1Effects of cisplatin and novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes on C TA, C TB, K AH, and K BOH of MDA-MB-221 breast cancer cellsGroupsParameters C TA (10?7 mol/m2) C TB (10?7 mol/m2) K AH (m3/mol) K BOH (107 m3/mol)MDA-MB-2311.90 � 0.081.31 � 0.0618.80 � 1.084.97 � 0.18MDA-MB-231 + cisplatin1.58 � 0.04a 1.48 � 0.05a 22.81 � 1.10a 3.97 � 0.12a MDA-MB-231 + [Pt2(L1)4B2]1.43 � 0.07a,b 1.63 � 0.06a,b 32.80 � 1.10a,b 3.62 � 0.19a,b MDA-MB-231 + [Pt2(L2)4B2]1.37 � 0.10a,b 1.69 � 0.08a,b 35.41 � 1.11a,b 3.54 � 0.12a,b MDA-MB-231 + [Pt2(L3)4B2]1.48 � 0.10a 1.51 � 0.09a 28.89 � 1.10a,b 3.81 � 0.11a MDA-MB-231 + [Pt2(L4)4B2]1.41 � 0.10a,b 1.59 � 0.10a 30.72 � 1.10a,b 3.65 � 0.11a,b MDA-MB-231 + [Pt2(L5)4B2]1.45 � 0.06a,b 1.62 � 0.05a,b 32.46 � 1.10a,b 3.67 � 0.10a,b p < 0.05 aCompared with cancer cell (MDA-MB-231) bCompared with cisplatin The experimental results indicate that cisplatin (new complexes) caused a decrease in negative charge numbers at the MCF-7 cell surface. This corresponded to a decrease surface concentration of CTA and an increased surface concentration of CTB. Similar to MDA-MB cells, changes in functional group composition on the membrane surface was due to the appearance or disappearance of functional groups on the MCF-7 cell surface. Cisplatin or new complexes increased the association constants of negatively charged KAH and decreased the association constants of positively charged KBOH groups (Table 2). Higher changes were observed after treatment with novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes compared with cisplatin.Table 2Effects of cisplatin and novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes on C TA, C TB, K AH, and K BOH of MCF-7 breast cancer cellsGroupsParameters C TA (10?7 mol/m2) C TB (10?7 mol/m2) K AH (m3/mol) K BOH (107 m3/mol)MCF-71.73 � 0,011.16 � 0,0926.81 � 1.10a 2.92 � 0.11a MCF-7 + cisplatin1.43 � 0.50a 1.31 � 0.05a 32.80 � 1.11a 3.17 � 0.10a MCF-7 + [Pt2(L1)4B2]1.25 � 0.06a,b 1.71 � 0.06a,b 48.47 � 1.10a,b 3.82 � 0.12a,b MCF-7 + [Pt2(L2)4B2]1.31 � 0.05a,b 1.54 � 0.05a,b 38.48 � 1.12a,b 3.98 � 0.14a,b MCF-7 + [Pt2(L3)4B2]1.30 � 0.06a,b 1.59 � 0.06a,b 37.52 � 1.15a,b 3.93 � 0.16a,b MCF-7 + [Pt2(L4)4B2]1.32 � 0.05a,b 1.60 � 0.07a,b 40.41 � 1.11a,b 3.87 � 0.12a,b MCF-7 + [Pt2(L5)4B2]1.32 � 0.04a,b 1.61 � 0.04a,b 39.54 � 1.16a,b 3.92 � 0.11a,b p < 0.05 aCompared with cancer cell (MCF-7) bCompared with cisplatin Table 3 shows levels of the lipid peroxidation product MDA measured by HPLC.

Many anticancer agents have been found to induce cancer cell apoptosis by increasing ROS (Chen et al. 2008). Growing evidences suggest that generation of ROS is an important cellular event induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Nonpublished our data shown significant increase in ROS level in the breast cancer cells after berenil�platinum(II) complexes. Moreover, it was shown that berenil�platinum(II) complexes are more potent antiproliferative agents than cisplatin. The degree to which these compounds inhibited cell growth breast cancer cells was generally consistent with their relative DNA-binding affinity, and detection of apoptosis by a fluorescent microscopy assay revealed that novel dinuclear platinum(II) complexes inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by increasing the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells (Bielawski et al. 2010; Poplawska et al. 2009). These complexes influence cellular metabolic pathways through the expression of transcription factor NFkB and in consequence increased expression MAPkinases (ERK1/2, p38) and IGF-1 and B1 integrin receptor (Bielawska et al. 2010). Cell membrane charge is affected by sialic acid present on glycolipids and glycoproteins and approximately 70 % of total sialic acid is found on the cell surface. It has been proposed that sialic acid also influences the surface concentration of CTA and CTB groups, as well as association constants with the positive and negative groups during cancer transformation and after drug treatment. The literature indicates that during cancer transformation, sialic acid content on glycolipids and glycoproteins increases (Oliva et al. 2006; Weigelt et al. 2005; Narayanan 1994). The decrease of sialic acid on cancer cells after of cisplatin or other drug treatments may be associated with an enhanced immune response of the host. It has been suggested that the loss of sialic acid decreases the surface concentration of CTA groups and may lead to increased cell deformity and enhanced susceptibility to phagocytosis (Nicol and Prasad 2002). Platinum(II) complexes preferentially attack membrane proteins. These complexes can also interact with phospholipids, but the bonds are relatively weak and reversible (Gea Speelmans et al. 1996; Chu 1994). The unstable interaction with phospholipids provokes changes in phospholipid conformation and in the structure and permeability of the membranes. The bond between platinum and monomeric proteins also provokes conformation changes and perturbs self-association of the monomers. The binding of platinum(II) complexes to the actin may be one of the reasons causes cell death by cross-linking and aggregating monomers, which depolymerizes microfilaments (Szachowicz-Petelska et al. 2001). Literature date show that at the molecular level, actin is indeed remodeled considerably in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cells (Sharma et al. 2012). The increase in the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells after dinuclear platinum(II) complexes confirm this suggestion, but the reason may be also connected with changes in metabolic pathway through the affect NFkB signaling (Poplawska et al. 2009). Proteins bound to DNA react with membrane phospholipids. Their activity in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination is modified by acidic phospholipids (Sekimizu 1994). It is suggested that the changes in membrane composition are connected with the changes in cell membrane charge. In conclusion, new platinum(II) complexes disturb the electrical properties and lipid peroxidation of cell membranes more effectively than cisplatin. The constants CTA, CTB, KAH, and KBOH are suitable for monitoring the changes caused by platinum(II) drugs. Therefore, evaluating the effects of anticancer drugs on the cell membrane may be an important component in future studies of cancer cell biology.

Our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity at the protein level is limited despite proteins being the ultimate effectors of cellular functions. We investigated the heterogeneity of breast cancer (41 primary tumors and 15 breast cancer cell lines) at the protein and phosphoprotein levels to identify activated oncogenic pathways and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Heterogeneity was observed not only across histological subtypes, but also within subtypes. Tumors of the Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype distributed across four different clusters where one cluster (cluster ii) showed high deregulation of many proteins and phosphoproteins. The majority of TNBC cell lines, particularly mesenchymal lines, resembled the cluster ii TNBC tumors. Indeed, TNBC cell lines were more sensitive than non-TNBC cell lines when treated with targeted inhibitors selected based on upregulated pathways in cluster ii. In line with the enrichment of the upregulated pathways with onco-clients of Hsp90, we found synergy in combining Hsp90 inhibitors with several kinase inhibitors, particularly Erk5 inhibitors. The combination of Erk5 and Hsp90 inhibitors was effective in vitro and in vivo against TNBC leading to upregulation of pro-apoptotic effectors. Our studies contribute to proteomic profiling and improve our understanding of TNBC heterogeneity to provide therapeutic opportunities for this disease. Breast cancer TNBC kinome cancer heterogeneity targeted therapy INTRODUCTION Gene expression profiling has contributed significantly to our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity, biology and prognosis. Patterns of gene expression dissect the heterogeneity of breast cancer into five subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER-2 and normal-like) that relate to histopathological parameters and immunophenotyping [1, 2]. More recently, integrative mutational and transcriptome profiling divides breast cancer to ten subgroups with distinct clinical outcome [3]. In contrast, our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity at the proteins level is limited despite proteins being the ultimate effectors of cellular functions. Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) are widely used multiplexed arrays to study selected proteins in clinical specimens. RPPA in microdissected breast tumors recognized the classification of breast cancer to subgroups according to protein and phosphoprotein level [4]. The robustness of RPPA in non-microdissected breast tumors has been illustrated from technical perspectives; variability in tissue handling and intratumoral vs. intertumoral heterogeneity [5]. Importantly, Hennessy et al [5] demonstrated that RPPA can classify breast tumors to the same subtypes deduced from transcriptome profiling. Moreover, this study supported the use of RPPA in non-microdissected breast tumors in the comprehensive cancer genome atlas (TCGA) study in breast cancer which also found proteome-based breast cancer subtypes which are highly concordant to transcriptome subtypes [6]. RPPA-based proteomics have also succeeded in the identification of proteins and phosphoproteins which associate with the prognosis of breast cancer [7-9]. Unlike RPPA which is limited to 100 � 200 analytes, mass spectroscopy (MS)-based proteomics can interrogate several hundreds of proteins. Indeed several studies used MS-based proteomics to identify biomarkers and targets for particular subtypes or disease progression and metastasis in breast cancer [10-12]. However, due to the complex nature of this approach, limited studies use MS to investigate the heterogeneity of breast cancer [13, 14]. These two studies, using cell lines, again revealed that the proteome fingerprint classify breast cancer to subtypes similar to transcriptome classification. Notably, although RPPA- and MS-based proteomic studies reveal concordance with transcriptome-based subtypes, these studies observed low correlation between protein and mRNA levels of their protein classifiers [5, 13, 14]. This suggests that although the proteome fingerprint retains a similar classification of breast cancer to the transcriptome fingerprint, the proteome fingerprint is not identical and may not be predicted from mRNA levels. The lack of strong correlation between mRNA abundance and protein expression is not surprising since this relationship is not direct [15, 16], thus supporting the need for protein profiling. In this article, we describe the profiling of protein levels and phosphorylation levels in aggressive/high grade primary breast tumors and established cell lines using the Kinex� antibody microarrays. The Kinex� antibody microarrays are as simple as RPPA technically but interrogate more than 400 kinases and kinase-associated proteins using validated antibodies [reviewed in 17]. The Kinex� antibody arrays have been used in several studies to compare cancer cell lines ([e.g. 18]). We focused on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); a subtype associated with poor prognosis, and found that a subgroup in TNBC showed the highest and complex deregulation of proteins and phosphoproteins in comparison to hormone-positive tumors. We found that breast cancer cell lines recapitulate the patterns observed in the primary tumors. In our effort to functionally translate our finding, we identified TNBC cell lines to be sensitive to targeted inhibitors of several of the activated kinases we identified in patient samples. Finally, based on our findings, we rationalized the combination of Hsp90 and Erk5 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy against TNBC and demonstrated the efficacy of this combination in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS Profiling of primary breast cancer tumors and cell lines with the Kinex� antibody arrays The Kinex� KAM-1.3 antibody microarrays contain 812 probes (in duplicates; i.e. > 1624 spots) which investigate more than 400 kinases and kinase-associated proteins. We extracted protein from 41 fresh frozen primary breast tumors; 15 triple negative (TNBC), 15 hormone positive (ER/PR-positive/HER2-negative) and 11 HER2-positive tumors. These histological subgroups were similar in terms of median patient age, tumor size, histological grade and tumor cell content (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, the correlation between the replicates of probes was higher than 0.85 for each tumor (Pearson's correlation coefficient, Supplementary Table S1); illustrating the consistency of these arrays. Using all the probes in the Kinex� arrays and unsupervised hierarchal clustering, the primary tumors separated to several clusters (Supplementary Fig. S1A), illustrating the heterogeneity of breast cancer at the protein and phosphoprotein levels. At least six clusters were defined by the sample-sample correlation plot shown in Fig.1A (clusters i � vi). Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) with a 1.75-fold cutoff (Supplementary Fig. S1B) identified 349 differentially expressed proteins and phosphoproteins between these six clusters (Fig.1B and Supplementary Table S2). TNBC tumors were heterogeneous where six TNBC tumors were in cluster ii along with one HER2-positive tumor and three TNBC tumors were alone in cluster i. Cluster iii contained three TNBC tumors with six HER2-positive tumors and one ER/PR-positive tumor and the remaining three TNBC tumors clustered with one ER/PR-positive tumors in cluster iv. Clusters v consisted of five ER/PR-positive and four HER2-positive tumors and cluster vi of eight ER/PR-positive tumors. We also profiled 15 breast cancer cell lines using the Kinex� KAM-1.3 antibody microarrays and found that the 349 differentially expressed probes from the patient tumors generated three clusters in the breast cancer cell lines (Fig.1C). One cluster contained five TNBC cell lines while the remaining four TNBC cell lines clustered with HER2-positive or ER-positive cell lines. Of note, most of TNBC cell lines we tested, particularly the mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and SUM159PT), resembled cluster ii in patients. We focused on cluster ii because it showed the highest deregulation of many probes compared to the other clusters and contained the largest number of TNBC primary tumors and TNBC cell lines. Figure 1 The Kinex antibody arrays confirm the heterogeneity of breast cancer Lysates from fresh frozen primary, high grade, breast tumors prior to therapy were subjected to the Kinex� antibody arrays (Supplementary Fig. S1). (A) Sample-sample correlation plot using all the probes revealed six clusters (i � vi) which were compared by the SAM method and 1.75-fold change cutoff (Supplementary Fig. S1). (B) Hierarchal clustering of patient tumors based on the differentially expressed proteins/phosphoproteins. The numbers on the right of the heat map mark the 14 branches which differentiate the tumor clusters and these are annotated in Supplementary Table 2S. (C) Lysates from established breast cancer cell lines were also subjected to the Kinex� arrays. Hierarchal clustering of the breast cancer cell lines was supervised by the probes that were differentially expressed across the six clusters of primary patient tumors Concordance of the Kinex� array results and the TCGA RPPA data We analyzed the RPPA data (level 3 data) from the breast cancer TCGA study data [6] in the same way we analyzed our Kinex� antibody arrays. In agreement with our results, at least six clusters were defined by the sample-sample correlation plot (Supplementary Fig. S2) using all the probes in the TCGA RPPA arrays (166 probes). TNBC tumors were heterogeneous where 16/58 (28%) of TNBC tumors appeared in one cluster, 32/58 (55%) of TNBC tumors appeared in a second cluster and the remaining 10/58 (17%) of TNBC tumors divided equally into two additional clusters (Supplementary Fig. S2). We compared the two main TNBC clusters to all other tumor clusters in the TCGA RPPA data and found that 65 probes that detect 61 proteins and phosphoproteins were deregulated in these tumors (1.5-fold cutoff, Supplementary Table S3). Of these 61 proteins and phosphoproteins, 26 did not have probes to detect them in the Kinex� antibody arrays; therefore we were able to compare the concordance between our results and the TCGA RPPA data based on 35 proteins/phosphoproteins. Of these 35 proteins/phosphoproteins in the TCGA RPPA, 24 (69%) were also deregulated in the TNBC clusters in our Kinex� arrays in the same direction (marked in Supplementary Table S3). The remaining 11 proteins/phosphoproteins in the TCGA RPPA results did not meet the threshold criteria in our study (7 proteins/phosphoproteins) or showed deregulation in the opposite direction (4 proteins/phosphoproteins). Thus, the heterogeneity and the clustering of breast cancer in general, and in TNBC specifically, could be replicated in the TCGA RPPA data which profiled more tumors. The advantage of the Kinex� antibody arrays however, resides in the larger coverage of proteins/phosphoproteins (812 probes in the Kinex� arrays vs. 166 probes in the TCGA RPPA). Altogether, there is a high agreement between our results and those from TCGA RPPA data. Validation of deregulated proteins and phosphoproteins in TNBC cluster ii To validate the deregulated phosphoproteins discovered in cluster ii in the Kinex� arrays, we used independent small arrays, the Proteome Profiler� Arrays for human phospho-kinases and phospho-MAPK pathway (R&D Systems). We compared the phosphorylation levels in four TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Hs.578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-435) which resemble cluster ii in patients and four luminal cell lines (MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-175 and ZR751)"
Breast_Cancer "which resemble cluster vi (pure ER/PR-positive) patients. As shown in Fig.2 and Supplementary Table S2, the R&D arrays validated the upregulation of 18 phosphoantibodies in cluster ii (marked in red). Furthermore, the R&D arrays identified additional phosphorylation sites of 15 upregulated phosphoproteins in cluster ii in the Kinex� arrays (marked in orange in Fig.2 and Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, 13 upregulated phosphoantibodies in the R&D arrays could be explained by the upregulation of the total protein in the Kinex� arrays (marked in blue in Fig.2 and Supplementary Table S2). Finally, the R&D arrays detected the upregulation of phosphoproteins (marked in black in Fig.2) which were not present in the differentially expressed phosphoproteins in the Kinex� arrays. Some of these phosphoantibodies were not present in the Kinex� arrays while the remaining did not meet the cutoff criteria in the analysis. In summary, of the 59 upregulated (> 1.5-fold) phosphorylations in cluster ii vs. cluster vi in the Kinex� arrays, the R&D arrays contained antibodies against 18 phosphorylation sites and all validated. Figure 2 Validation of phosphorylations of proteins identified in the Kinex� antibody arrays using the Proteome Profiler antibody arrays Lysates from four TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Hs.578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-435) and four luminal cell lines (MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-175 and ZR751) were analyzed using the Proteome Profiler� Array for (A) human phospho-kinases and (B) human phospho-MAPK pathway. Bar graphs show the average ratio of TNBC/luminal normalized intensity for each phosphoprotein (�SEM, n = 4 cell lines each with two technical replicate for each phosphoprotein). Dashed lines mark the 1-fold (no change) and the 2-fold ratios and insets show representative arrays. Red bars: probes which validate exact phosphorylations in the Kinex� arrays. Orange bars: probes that identify additional phosphorylations of phosphoproteins to those identified in the Kinex� arrays. Blue bars: probes identifying phosphoproteins that were upregulated at the protein level in the Kinex� arrays. Black bars: probes that were not present in the Kinex� arrays or did not meet the cutoff criteria in analysis Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA�) software to determine networks and pathways that describe the protein-protein interactions (PPI) relationships between the deregulated proteins and phosphoproteins in cluster ii tumors compared to cluster vi tumors. Three overlapping networks were enriched in this analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and were merged to obtain one network (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The canonical signaling pathways that were activated by the deregulation of proteins/phosphoproteins in the cluster ii subgroup are shown in Fig.3A. By analyzing the network of direct protein-protein interactions for upregulated proteins and phosphoproteins only, robust and cross-talking signaling cascades from the plasma membrane to the nucleus were identified in cluster ii tumors (Fig.3B). At least two nodes, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) nodes, were at the center of these complex signaling cascades and pathways. Figure 3 Pathway analysis of deregulated proteins and phosphoproteins in TNBC Pathway analysis in IPA� using only direct protein-protein interaction data was used and the deregulated proteins/phosphoproteins in TNBC cluster ii identified three overlapping networks. These networks were merged and visualized (Supplementary Fig. S3). (A) Canonical signaling pathways using IPA� which were enriched (Fisher's exact test p-value) in the deregulated proteins/phosphoproteins in TNBC cluster ii subgroup. (B) The upregulated phosphoproteins (marked with P) and proteins in cluster ii were analyzed using IPA� and a single network of direct protein-protein interactions was identified. Shades of pink/red reflect the extent of upregulation. At least two nodes, MAPKs and HSPs, were clearly identified in the center of complex signaling cascades. Figure 4 Targeted inhibition of activated kinases in cluster ii kills TNBC cell lines (A) Activated cross-talking canonical signaling pathways in TNBC tumors in cluster ii. (B) Six TNBC cell lines, four non-TNBC cell lines and the �near-normal� MCF10A cell line were treated (in duplicates) with escalating doses of the specified drugs and survival was measured six days after treatment using the CellTitre� assay. Data shown is -log10[IC50], a measure of sensitivity, where red color denotes relative increase in sensitivity. The red box marks drugs which specifically killed TNBC cell lines in comparison to non-TNBC cell lines. The raw data of dose response curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. (C & D) Two Hsp90 inhibitors (PF04929113 and AUY922) were separately used as single agents or in combination with the specified kinase inhibitors. The combinations were performed using the IC25 of each drug against the specified TNBC cell lines. Data shown is the survival of cells where red color represents more killing than green color. Raw data for panels C and D are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Proteomic profiles may not be accurately predicted by transcriptome profiling The phosphorylation of proteins may not be predicted by changes in mRNA levels; however, the upregulation of proteins may be associated with increased abundance of mRNA transcripts. To this end, we interrogated the Oncomine� database to determine whether the upregulated proteins in our screen were accompanied with elevated mRNA in TNBC. We analyzed two large patient datasets, the TCGA [6] and the METABRIC [3], and the Neve et al. breast cancer cell lines dataset [19], and found that only 9 of the 49 (18%) upregulated proteins we identified in TNBC had evidence for elevated mRNA levels (Supplementary Table S4). This poor protein-mRNA correlation was in agreement with previous proteomic-based profiling in breast cancer [5, 13, 14]. Upon closer examination, we found that many of the activated kinases in our screen are oncoclients of the heat shock protein Hsp90; known to stabilize these proteins [20-22]; thus the elevation of proteins in cluster ii may be due to stabilization rather than elevation of mRNA levels. In agreement, the upregulation of Hsp90 protein was consistently detected in TNBC tumors and cell lines using 10 independent probes on the Kinex� arrays. In vitro survival and growth after inhibition of signaling networks Based on the signaling cascades envisioned from the kinome profiling/pathway analysis above and outlined in Fig.4A, we compared the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT549, MDA-MB-436, Hs.578T, MDA-MB-468 and BT20), non-TNBC cell lines (MCF7, T47D, ZR751 and BT474) and the �near-normal� MCF10A cell line to 24 small molecule inhibitors. Cell survival at six days after treatment showed that TNBC breast cancer cell lines were more sensitive than non-TNBC cell lines to 13 drugs (Fig.4B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Given the high level of Hsp90 we identified and the role of this chaperon in oncogene activation, we investigated the combinations of the molecular inhibitors with Hsp90 inhibitors. Two different inhibitors of Hsp90 showed synergy in the killing of TNBC cell lines when combined with inhibitors targeting PAK1, FAK/PYK2, IGF-1R/IR, PKC, AKT/p70S6K, GSK3, p38 MAPK, JNK, DNA-PK or Erk5 (Fig. 4C&D and Supplementary Fig. S5). Particularly, the combination of Hsp90 inhibition with Erk5 inhibition produced the highest and most consistent synergy amongst the six TNBC cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. S5). Erk5 as a therapeutic target in TNBC We focused on the inhibition of Erk5 (MAPK7) since Erk5 is an attractive target for cancer therapy [23, 24]. We confirmed the higher level of Erk5 in TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S6). Activated Erk5 is not a client of Hsp90 [25] and the ERK5/Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway is activated while the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is inhibited in response to Hsp90 inhibition [22]. Hsp90 inhibition in TNBC was shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and decrease the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein [26]. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the synergy we observed when combining Erk5 inhibition with Hsp90 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6). To expand on this synergy, we investigated the combination of Erk5 inhibition with Hsp90 inhibition in cell killing across various doses. Indeed, low doses of Hsp90 inhibitors (Hsp90i) with the Erk5 inhibitor XMD 8-92 (Erk5i) showed strong synergy (Fig. 5A-C). Using these low doses, the phosphorylation of Erk5 was inhibited by the Erk5i and Hsp70 stabilization (surrogate marker for Hsp90 inhibition) was detected with the Hsp90i, confirming the specificity of these inhibitors (Fig.5D). The combination of Erk5i and Hsp90i or Erk5i with chemotherapy resulted in significant decrease in the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and decrease in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein (Fig.5D). This explained the significant decrease in clonogenic survival observed in these combinations (Fig.5E). Figure 5 The combination of Hsp90 inhibition and Erk5 inhibition is synergistic in TNBC (A&B) Cultures of six TNBC cell lines were treated with escalating doses of ERK5i XMD 8-92 combined with Hsp90i PF-04929113 (A) or the Hsp90i AUY922 (B) to calculate the combination index (CI, < 1 is synergistic). (C) Graph of CI for the Hsp90 inhibitors at the lowest doses with Erk5 inhibition. (D) Immunoblot analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 1 �M Erk5i (XMD 8-92) alone, 2 nM of Hsp90i (AUY922) alone, chemotherapy alone (2.5 nM docetaxel and 10 nM doxorubicin) or the combinations at 24 hours after treatment with indicated antibodies. (E) Clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-231 cells when subjected to treatments as indicated in D at 72 hours or 96 hours. Based on our in vitro results, we investigated these combinations with Erk5 inhibitor in vivo using the MDA-MB-231 TNBC xenografts model. Tumors treated with Erk5i alone (XMD 8-92 at 25 mg/kg) or Hsp90i alone (AUY922 at 25 mg/kg) showed a moderate delay in tumor growth (Fig.6A). We confirmed the inhibition of Erk5 phosphorylation by the Erk5i and the stabilization of Hsp70 by the Hsp90i by immunoblots on tumor lysates prepared on day 13 after the completion of treatments (Fig.6B and Supplementary Fig. S7). While the combination of Erk5i with chemotherapy (docetaxel+doxorubicin) reduced tumor growth, the combination of Erk5i and Hsp90i showed a strong anti-tumor response (Fig.6A). The latter combination was associated with prolonged apoptotic cell death as judged by the increase of pro-apoptotic Bcl family members Bim and Bak and the cleavage of PARP1 (Fig.6B and Supplementary Fig. S7) and ApopTag staining by IHC (Fig.6D&E). We also detected a significant increase in DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) detected by ?H2AX staining (Fig.6F) and a significant reduction in tumor cellularity as measured by the ratio of cells to collagen in trichrome staining (Fig.6G). Collectively, our results confirm the synergy of the combination of Hsp90 and Erk5 inhibitors in vivo which could be explained by significant induction of apoptotic cell death and tumor tissue degeneration. Figure 6 The combination of Erk5 and Hsp90 inhibitors in vivo Female nude mice bearing the TNBC MDA-MB-231 xenografts (50mm3 volume) were untreated (vehicle control) or treated with chemotherapy (chemo; 2 mg/kg docetaxel and 10 mg/kg doxorubicin administered i.p. on days 1 and 8). Additional groups of mice were treated with Erk5 inhibitor alone (Erk5i XMD 8-92 at 25 mg/kg) or Hsp90 inhibitor alone (Hsp90i AUY922 at 25 mg/kg) daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12. Additional groups of mice were treated with the combinations; chemo+Erk5i or Hsp90i+Erk5i. Six tumors were excised on day 13 (after treatment completion) for ex vivo studies.

DISCUSSION Proteomic profiling of high-grade breast cancers using the Kinex� antibody microarrays confirmed the heterogeneity of breast cancer in general with the identification of at least six subgroups. Particularly, TNBC is heterogeneous at the proteomic level where one subgroup of TNBC showed a wide spectrum of activated oncogenic signaling pathways in comparison to other TNBC tumors as well as non-TNBC subtypes. The activated signaling pathways we found in this TNBC subgroup (cluster ii) did not associate with increased mRNA expression in published gene expression microarray datasets. Our results, and others [5, 13, 14], revealed that the proteomic fingerprint classifies breast cancer to similar subtypes as transcriptome profiling; however, the two fingerprints are not identical. The TNBC tumors in our proteomic study divided across four different tumor clusters with strong differences at the protein and phosphoprotein levels. Our finding is in line with previous studies reporting heterogeneity within TNBC. Immunophenotypically, TNBC can be at least divided into basal-like and non-basal like groups [27]. At the transcriptome level, while the majority (~ 70%) of TNBC tumors are classified as basal-like, the remainder are spread across the other intrinsic subtypes; luminal A and B, Her2-enriched and normal-like [28]. The extent of TNBC heterogeneity has been further characterized by Lehmann et al. [29] in a study which identified six molecular subtypes of TNBC based on gene expression analysis. Similarly, we found that 9 out of 15 (60%) TNBC tumors clustered together (clusters i and ii) whereas the rest (6 out of 15, 40%) were admixed with hormone-positive or HER2-positive tumors (clusters iii and iv) [5]. Similarly, we found that 9 out of 15 (60%) TNBC tumors clustered together (clusters i and ii) whereas the rest (6 out of 15, 40%) clustered closer to hormone-positive or HER2-positive tumors (clusters iii and iv). In our study, the TNBC tumors in cluster ii were related to TNBC cell lines that are classified as mesenchymal- and mesenchymal-stem like at the transcriptome level [29]. These tumors and cell lines showed robust signaling cascades with cross-talking canonical signaling pathways some of which have been previously described as targets for TNBC such as ERK/MAPK [11], JAK/STAT signaling [30, 31] "
Breast_Cancer "and PI3K/AKT/PTEN [32, 33]. In an effort to translate our findings into therapeutic strategies, we showed that TNBC cell lines were sensitive to several inhibitors which were selected based on the activated signaling pathways identified by proteomic profiling. Similar differential responses of breast cancer cell lines, according to subtypes and/or pathways, to therapeutics have been previously reported [34]. Our study only shared three inhibitors with the previous study [34] which target MEK or EGFR and our results are in agreement that TNBC cell lines are more sensitive to these inhibitors than luminal breast cancer cell lines. The advantage of our study is that the selection of drugs was envisaged by proteomic characterization of pathway activation. Moreover, we identified synergistic effects when combining activated kinase inhibitors with inhibitors of the chaperone Hsp90. The heat shock protein Hsp90 has been described as a therapeutic target in TNBC [26] and we recognized that not only Hsp90 was upregulated in TNBC tumors and cell lines in our study, but also that several of the activated kinases we identified are onco-clients of Hsp90. We hypothesized that the inhibition of Hsp90 would lead to inhibition of several signaling pathways identified in our study and that the additional inhibition of specific pathway would lead to enhanced toxicity in TNBC cells. Indeed, we found the combined inhibition of Hsp90 and one of 11 other kinases was synergistic, particularly, the combination of Hsp90 and Erk5 inhibition. We focused on Erk5 as a novel target in TNBC. Erk5 regulates the Nrf2 (NFE2L2) transcription factor [35] which was also upregulated in TNBC in our study. Activated Erk5 is not a client of Hsp90 [25] and the Erk5/Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway is activated in response to Hsp90 inhibition [22]. Erk5 has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy [23, 24]. Using breast cancer cell lines, studies showed that Erk5 plays roles in cell proliferation by regulating cyclin D1 and CDKs [36-38], epithelial mesenchymal transition [39], MET/HGF-induced migration [40, 41] and integrin/FAK-mediated metastasis [42]. The MEK5-Erk5 pathway mediates progression to an ER-negative, mesenchymal and endocrine therapy resistant phenotype [43]. Experimentally, the knockdown of MEKK2-MEK5-Erk5 pathway affects the primary tumor growth and metastasis in xenografts model of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 [44]. Clinically, Erk5 protein is overexpressed in early stage breast cancer and associated with disease free survival [45]. In a recent study [43], activated (phosphorylated) Erk5 was found in 77% of breast tumors in comparison to adjacent tissue. In our previous study of aggressive breast tumors which metastasized to the brain [46], we also found activated Erk5 in 78% of these tumors and more importantly, we found activated Erk5 in 100% of brain metastasis from breast tumors (p = 0.032 cf. 78% in matched primary breast tumors [46]). Altogether, Erk5 is an attractive therapeutic target in breast cancer, particularly in TNBC. To our knowledge, we are the first to report targeting Erk5 using a molecular inhibitor in vivo in breast cancer. Our in vivo study demonstrated the utility of Erk5 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy alone or in combination with chemotherapy and more so when combined with Hsp90 inhibition in TNBC. In conclusion, we report the first proteomic study of breast cancer using the Kinex� antibody arrays that can interrogate several hundred more proteins and phosphoproteins than RPPA and in a less complex fashion than mass spectroscopy-based proteomics. The proteomic-fingerprint from the Kinex� antibody arrays, similar to RPPA- and MS-based proteomics, identified subtypes within breast cancer that reflect transcriptome profiling; however, the proteomic- and transcriptome-fingerprints were not necessarily identical. The more direct translational path of proteomic profiling for identifying therapeutic targets was illustrated by the identification of several inhibitors which affect the survival of the aggressive TNBC cell lines. Our in vivo studies support the notion that the inhibition of several oncogenic pathways is required for making an impact against TNBCs which exploit cross-talking pathways to drive their aggressive phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS Primary breast tumor collection and cell culture The Brisbane Breast Bank collected fresh breast tumor samples from consenting patients; the study was approved by the local research ethics committees. Clinical, histopathological and the status for estrogen [ER] and progesterone [PR] receptors and HER2 were obtained from pathology reports (Supplementary Table S1). The cut off for ER and PR positivity was 1% and the HER2 status was defined using the HercepTest� (Dako). Breast cancer cell lines from ATCC� (VA, USA) were cultured as per ATCC� instruction and tested for mycoplasma and authenticated using STR profiling. Kinex� antibody and Proteome Profiler� arrays Fresh frozen primary breast tumors and fresh frozen cell lines were lysed using the Kinex� lysis buffer as per the manufacturer instructions (Kinexus Corporation, Vancouver, Canada). Dye-labeling of protein lysates, hybridization to the Kinex� antibody array (KAM-1.3 Antibody Microarray) and signal intensity extraction were performed by Kinexus Corporation. Signal intensities for the 812 probes (in technical replicates), which included pan-specific antibodies for total proteins and phospho-specific antibodies against specific phosphorylations, were analyzed using BRB-ArrayTools [47]. Signal intensities were quantile-normalized to perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering and Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM). For the Proteome Profiler� arrays, lysates from cell lines were hybridized to the arrays and phosphorylation levels were detected and quantified as per manufacturer instructions (R&D Systems, MN, USA). Ingenuity pathway analysis and Oncomine� analysis Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis� (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems�, Redwood City, CA) and we limited the analysis to direct protein-protein interactions only to identify signaling networks and canonical signaling pathways. The Oncomine� database [48] (Compendia Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI), a large consortium of gene expression microarray datasets, was interrogated for the mRNA expression levels of proteins identified in our screen. In vitro drug sensitivity screens Small molecule inhibitors were purchased from Tocris Biosciences (R&D Systems): PF-4708671, U 73122, GSK2334470, IPA3, SL0101-1 and XMD 8-92 or from Selleck Chemicals LLC (TX, USA): PF-562271, Enzastaurin (LY317615), AUY922 (NVP-AUY922), 17-AAG (Geldanamycin), PF-04929113 (SNX-5422), AZD6244 (Selumetinib), AT7867, CHIR-98014, LY2228820, BIX 02188, AS703026, PH-797804, SP600125, NU7441. All inhibitors were prepaed in DMSO at 100 mM. Cells were treated with inhibitors prepared in culture media where the final concentration of DMSO was 2% v/v. Vehicle control treatments consisted of culture media containing 2% v/v DMSO. Six days after treatment, cell survival was measured in comparison to vehicle controls using the CellTiter 96� Assay as per manufacturer instructions (MTS assay, Promega Corporation, WI, USA). Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism� version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) to measure the log10 of IC50 for each drug. For combination assays, drugs were added simultaneously. Heatmaps for sensitivities (-log10 of IC50) were prepared using D-chip Analyzer software [49]. In vivo models and treatments The local animal ethics committee gave approval for use of the mice. Female balb/c nude mice at 5 weeks of age (Animal Resources Centre, WA, Australia) were inoculated in the mammary fat-pads with exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells (5�106 per fat pad) in 50 �L of 50:50 PBS:Matrigel� (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Treatments started when tumors were 50 � 1 mm3 as calculated from caliper measurement of tumor's longest (a) and shortest (b) diameters: tumor volume (mm3) = a/2 � b2. Docetaxel, doxorubicin and the Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals and the Erk5 inhibitor XMD 8-92 from Tocris Biosciences. All drugs were diluted in 5% solution of D-glucose in PBS for intraperitoneal injection. Doses and schedule of treatments are detailed in Figure legends. Mice were monitored for change in weight and other toxicity indications and none were observed. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurements to calculate the change in tumor volume compared to day 0. Six tumors were excised on day 13 to perform ex vivo studies as below. In vitro and ex vivo studies for the combination of Hsp90 and Erk5 inhibition For the combination index studies in vitro, cultures of TNBC cell lines were left untreated or treated with escalating doses of the Erk5 inhibitor alone, Hsp90 inhibitor alone or the combinations. After 6 days of treatment, the MTS assay was performed to measure survival in comparison to control untreated cells. The combination index (CI) was calculated for each combination according to Chou [50]. For immunoblot assays, the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 1 �M Erk5i alone, 2 nM of Hsp90i alone, chemotherapy alone (2.5 nM docetaxel and 10 nM doxorubicin) or the combinations. After 24 hours of treatments, lysates were prepared and standard immunobloting was performed. For ex vivo studies, tumors excised from mice on day 13 (after treatment completion) were bisected where one half was fixed in 10% saline-buffered formalin solution and the second half was used to prepare protein lysates. Standard immunoblots were performed on lysates from cells grown in vitro and from tumors excised after treatments. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Erk5, phospho-Erk5 (Thr218/Tyr220), Hsp70, Hsp90, Erk1/2 and phosphor-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) were purchased from Cell Signaling (MA, USA). The rabbit monoclonal antibodies against Bak and Bim were from Epitomics (CA, USA). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against Bcl-xL and ?-actin were from BD Biosciences (CA, USA). The rabbit monoclonal antibody against COXIV was purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (NE, USA). Secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP were from Cell Signaling and blots were developed using developed using the chemiluminescence reagent plus (Millipore, MA, USA). Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumors were used for standard H&E or Masson's trichrome staining. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was performed to detect double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) using the anti-phospho-histone H2AX (Ser139, ?H2AX) mAb (clone JBW301, Merk Millipore. MA, USA) or apoptosis using ApopTag� Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merk Millipore) as per manufacturer instructions. For IHC quantification, images of ten random regions from each tumor section were analyzed using ImageJ [51] (V1.46d) with ImmunoRatio plugin [52]. Masson's trichrome was analyzed using ImageJ as previously described [53] using images of ten random regions from each tumor section. Standard immunoblotting was performed using lysates prepared from freshly isolated tumors. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the Kinex� antibody arrays was performed in ArrayTools as described above. Other statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism�.

Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the image quality of standard single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) and that of readout-segmented EPI (rs-EPI) in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods Seventy-one patients with 74 breast cancers underwent both ss-EPI and rs-EPI. For qualitative comparison of image quality, three readers independently assessed the two sets of diffusion-weighted (DW) images. To evaluate geometric distortion, a comparison was made between lesion lengths derived from contrast enhanced MR (CE-MR) images and those obtained from the corresponding DW images. For assessment of image parameters, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lesion contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. Results The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in most criteria regarding the qualitative image quality. Anatomical structure distinction, delineation of the lesion, ghosting artifact, and overall image quality were significantly better in rs-EPI. Regarding the geometric distortion, lesion length on ss-EPI was significantly different from that of CE-MR, whereas there were no significant differences between CE-MR and rs-EPI. The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in SNR and CNR. Conclusion Readout-segmented EPI is superior to ss-EPI in the aspect of image quality in DW MR imaging of the breast. Breast neoplasm Magnetic resonance imaging Diffusion-weighted MRI Ministry of Health and Welfare A070001 INTRODUCTION Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast is well-established as a valuable technique in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The contrast enhanced MR imaging (CE-MRI), particularly, have been widely performed for the evaluation of breast tumors (1, 2, 3). Breast MRI has a high sensitivity but only a moderate specificity for the characterization of breast lesions (4). In recent years, results of many studies have shown that diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging may improve lesion characterization in MR imaging (5, 6, 7). DW imaging provides physiological information about the functional environment and movement of water in normal versus abnormal tissues (6), and it also allows measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in breast tissue. The previous studies suggest that ADCs could be an effective parameter in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast lesions (7), whereby low ADCs are associated with malignancy (5, 6). Single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) is the routine sequence for clinical DW imaging. However, they suffer from susceptibility artifacts that manifest as geometric distortion, signal dropout, and image blurring (8). The distortions are mainly ascribed to the slow traversal through k-space along the phase-encoding direction (9), leading to a low bandwidth in this direction that causes blurring and geometric distortion. These artifacts can be diminished by accelerating the k-space traversal along the phase-encoding direction. This distortion can be reduced by readout-segmented EPI (rs-EPI). This multi-shot sequence, in which an EPI readout is used to sample a subset of k-space points in the readout direction at each shot, allows a substantial reduction in echo spacing and an associated reduction in the time taken to traverse k-space in the phase-encoding direction (10). This leads to reduction in distortion and blurring caused by T2* decay during the readout. The readout-segmented sampling scheme has been known for a number of years (11), but recent technical improvements (10, 12) have integrated the method with 2-dimensional navigator correction, to allow a robust correction for the shot-to-shot phase errors that occur in diffusion-weighted imaging (13). A number of studies have assessed the image quality of rs-EPI in the brain, but there are fewer reports concerning applications in the breast imaging (14). The purpose of our study was to compare the image quality between the standard ss-EPI and the rs-EPI in patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, with the requirement for informed patient consent waived. Of 736 patients who underwent breast MRI from January 2012 to December 2012, 178 patients underwent both ss-EPI and rs-EPI. We retrospectively reviewed the radiology and pathology records of those potential patients. Breast MRI findings were reported according to the level of suspicion of malignancy, by using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. Along with already known biopsy-proven cancers (BI-RADS category 6), BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions which were later pathologically confirmed as malignancy were also included. Of the 178 patients, 84 were excluded for not having a suspicious abnormality on dynamic images, 16 were excluded for having non-mass enhancement type lesions, 6 were excluded for not having pathological verification, and one was excluded because the lesion was not discernible on CE-MRI due to prominent background parenchymal enhancement of the breast. Therefore, 71 patients with 74 lesions were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 52.7 � 11.4 years (range, 30-88 years). All lesions were pathologically verified either by surgery (n = 65) or by imaging-guided biopsy (n = 9). Image Acquisition Imaging was performed with a 3.0 T MAGNETOM Verio MR system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a dedicated surface breast coil with the patient in a prone position. The MR images were acquired using the following sequences: 1) axial, turbo spin-echo T2-weighted imaging sequence; repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE), 3530/93 ms; flip angle, 80�; field-of-view (FOV), 320 � 320 mm; matrix size, 576 � 403; slice thickness, 4 mm; and acquisition time, 2 minutes 28 seconds. 2) two DW imaging sequences (i.e., ss-EPI and rs-EPI); b values, 0 and 750 s/mm2; TR/TE, 9800/87 ms and 5600/55 ms, respectively; FOV, 340 � 117 mm and 360 � 180 mm, respectively; matrix size, 192 � 82; slice thickness, 4 mm; acquisition time, 2 minutes 47 seconds and 2 minutes 31 seconds, respectively; and 5 readout segments for rs-EPI. 3) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated automatically by using MRI software from the DW images. 4) pre- and post-contrast, axial T1-weighted flash three-dimensional Volumetric Interpolated Breath-Hold Examination sequence; TR/TE, 4.4/1.7 ms; flip angle, 10�; FOV, 320 � 320 mm; matrix size, 512 � 292; slice thickness, 1.2 mm; acquisition time, 6 minutes 7 seconds; obtained before and at 7, 67, 127, 187, 247, and 307 seconds after an injection of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of gadobutrol (Gadovist, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). After the examination, the unenhanced images were subtracted from the post-contrast images. Maximum-intensity projection images were created from the early phase of the subtraction images. Qualitative Comparison of Image Quality For the assessment of DW image quality, three fellowship-trained breast radiologists, each of whom had at least 8 years of experience in interpreting breast MR imaging, independently reviewed and visually assessed the two sets of DW images and ADC maps with CE-MR images as references. The readers scored the images based on five criteria: distinction of the anatomical structure, delineation of the lesion, degree of ghosting artifact, uniformity of fat suppression, and overall image quality (Table 1). Before the study, one of the readers reviewed all breast MR images, including T2-weighted images, dynamic contrast-enhanced images, DW images, and ADC maps, to identify pathologically proven lesions. The reader provided reference images corresponding to each score for each criterion. After training for the scoring system at the consensus meeting, each reader independently assessed the ss-EPI and rs-EPI images from the patients. The included cases were anonymized and randomized, and then they were provided to the readers. Quantitative Comparison of Image Quality Geometric distortion was evaluated by comparing lesion lengths between CE-MR images and the corresponding DW images. Anterior-posterior (AP) length and left-right (LR) width of the lesions were measured and the differences were calculated. For the assessment of image parameters, regions-of-interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the same area of both DW images in all 74 lesions and normal breast parenchyma. Lesion ROIs were drawn in the center of the mass with high signal intensity in DW images then copied to the ADC map (Fig. 1). ROIs in DW images were drawn with reference to CE-MR images, while avoiding fatty tissue or the necrotic portion. If the lesion was not visible in DW images, the case was excluded from the quantitative analysis. Normal tissue ROIs were drawn in homogeneous breast parenchyma without enhancement in the contralateral breast. For each ROI, mean signal intensity and standard deviation were determined. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was determined by the ratio between the mean signal intensity inside the ROI (SROI) and the standard deviation of the background noise (?BG) (SNR = SROI / ?BG). Contrast was determined by the ratio between SROI and that of normal tissue on DW images (ST) (contrast = SROI / ST). Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was determined by the difference between SROI and ST divided by the standard deviation in the lesion ROI (?ROI) and normal tissue ROI (?T), using the following equation: The ADC and size of the ROI were recorded. These quantitative measurements were performed by a breast radiology fellow. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Regarding the image quality, inter-observer agreement was assessed with the kappa statistics. The average scores of the three readers were calculated and used for analysis. Differences in image quality, discrepancy in lesion lengths, and image parameters between ss-EPI and rs-EPI were compared using the paired t test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS Patients A total of 74 malignant lesions were identified in 71 patients. One patient had two lesions and another patient had three lesions. According to BI-RADS classification, there was one case of category 4 and one case of category 5 in MR imaging. The other 72 cases were category 6 lesions. Malignant lesions were identified as 59 (79.7%) invasive ductal carcinomas, 5 (6.8%) ductal carcinoma in situ, 5 (6.8%) invasive lobular carcinomas, 2 (2.7%) mucinous carcinomas, 2 (2.7%) invasive mammary carcinomas, and 1 (1.3%) invasive tubular carcinoma. The maximum diameter of the lesions ranged from 4.4 to 88.8 mm with a mean size of 20.0 mm on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Qualitative Comparison of Image Quality The three readers were in fair inter-observer agreement regarding the overall image quality (? = 0.428). The average numbers given by the three readers for distinguishable anatomical structures (total 4 structures) were 1.7 for ss-EPI and 3.5 for rs-EPI. For delineation of the lesion, the mean scores were 3.0 (identifiable) for ss-EPI and 4.6 (well identifiable to blurry borders) for rs-EPI. For ghosting artifact, they were 3.0 (present, but little impact on interpretation) for ss-EPI and 3.2 for rs-EPI. For fat suppression, they were 2.5 (inhomogeneous to homogeneous fat suppression) for ss-EPI and 2.3 for rs-EPI. For overall image quality, they were 2.7 (poor to acceptable) for ss-EPI and 4.7 (standard to above average) for rs-EPI (Table 2). The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in most criteria regarding the image quality (Fig. 2). Distinction of anatomical structures (p < 0.001), delineation of the lesion (p < 0.001), ghosting artifact (p = 0.034), and overall image quality (p < 0.001) were significantly better in rs-EPI. Fat suppression did not differ statistically between the two groups (p = 0.055). Regarding the delineation of the lesion, all lesions were visible by all readers on rs-EPI. Meanwhile, 19 lesions were not identified by all or some readers in ss-EPI (Table 3). Of the 19 lesions, 10 lesions were not identified by any of the readers and 9 lesions were only identified by some reader(s). Among 17 lesions which is less than 1 cm in the maximum length, 9 lesions were visible by all readers and 8 lesions were not visible by some or all readers. Quantitative Comparison of Image Quality Twelve lesions were not visible or not measurable on ss-EPI, while all lesions were visible on rs-EPI on quantitative evaluation. The twelve cases were excluded from the quantitative analysis. The average AP length of the lesions was 19.6 � 13.5 mm on CE-MRI, 18.4 � 13.3 mm on ss-EPI, and 19.4 � 13.3 mm on rs-EPI. The average LR width was 20.8 � 15.3 mm on CE-MRI, 19.7 � 15.0 mm on ss-EPI, and 20.4 � 15.1 mm on rs-EPI (Fig. 3). They were measured to be smaller in both sets of DW images. Whereas there were no significant differences in AP length and LR width between CE-MR and rs-EPI (p = 0.212, p = 0.107), AP length and LR width were significantly smaller in ss-EPI (p = 0.003, p = 0.010) (Fig. 4). There were high correlations for the lesion lengths between CE-MR images and each DW image (Fig. 5). The Pearson correlation coefficient for the maximum size between the histopathology and the CE-MRI was 0.708. The comparison of results for image parameters between ss-EPI and rs-EPI are listed in Table 4. SNR, contrast, and CNR were 104.6, 3.4, and 3.2 for ss-EPI, respectively, and 301.7, 3.0, and 4.9 for rs-EPI, respectively. The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in SNR (p < 0.001) and CNR (p = 0.013). There were no significant differences in ROI size, contrast, and ADC between ss-EPI and rs-EPI (p = 0.578, p = 0.122, p = 0.631). The Pearson correlation coefficient of the ADC between ss-EPI and rs-EPI was 0.902. DISCUSSION The diagnostic utility of DWI has been limited in the assessment of breast lesions, because of its inferior image quality particularly compared to CE-MRI. However, the advancements in imaging technology are providing evidence for the potential use of this MR imaging technique, which does not require the use of intravenous contrast agent (5, 6, 7, 14). If the image quality is sufficiently good, DW images can be used not only for measurement of signal intensity and ADC, but also for morphological analysis of the lesions. Our study demonstrates that the quality of DW imaging can be significantly improved by using the rs-EPI sequence. Regarding the qualitative assessment, rs-EPI was found to be superior to ss-EPI in overall image quality, anatomical structure distinction, and conspicuity of the lesions. It is consistent with previously published studies (8, 14, 15, 16). In a recent study investigating the diagnostic value of rs-EPI in 47 patients of breast lesions, rs-EPI provided higher image quality and lesion conspicuity compared to ss-EPI (14). The study also reported that rs-EPI reached higher diagnostic accuracy for the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions. The other study compared rs-EPI and ss-EPI in DW images of the pediatric brain and concluded that rs-EPI provided improved image quality (8). Regarding the delineation of the lesion, 19 lesions were not identified by all or some readers in ss-EPI. In contrast, there was no lesion that was not visible by any readers in rs-EPI. The difference in visibility of lesions between the two sequences can be attributed to the improved point spread function (PSF) with rs-EPI, because of the reduction in T2* blurring. This effectively improves resolution. The spatial distortion is a major disadvantage of ss-EPI in DW images. Because the distortions in ss-EPI are mainly due to slow traversal through the k-space along the phase-encoding direction, it can be improved by accelerating the k-space traversal along the direction (9, 10). The rs-EPI sequence provides a significantly higher overall quality by reducing spatial distortion and image blurring. Previous studies compared the distortions in the two DW images sequences either qualitatively or quantitatively and demonstrated the reduced distortion in rs-EPI (8, 14, 15, 16). In a study of DW in stroke patients, the distortion was evaluated by measuring the AP length of the pons (16). The rs-EPI images exhibited significantly less pontine distortion. We quantitatively assessed image distortion by comparing the discrepancy in lesion lengths between CE-MR images and each corresponding DW image. AP length and LR width were significantly smaller in ss-EPI when compared to CE-MRI. In particular, the discrepancy in AP length was greater. Some lesions were flatter while some lesions were longer in the AP direction. Sometimes, this spatial distortion caused marked change in the location of the lesion. With regard to the image parameters, rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in SNR and CNR. Our results are consistent with those of Morelli et al. (16), who compared ss-EPI and rs-EPI in the brain MRI. However, SNR in rs-EPI was lower than that in ss-EPI in the other studies (8, 14). In a study of breast cancer patients, no difference was found in CNR between the two DW images (14). Regarding the SNR, the reduction in the overall length of rs-EPI is disadvantageous, because noise scales inversely with the square root of the readout time. However, the shorter readout also means that the echo time is reduced, which results in the increased signal level and the SNR. The degree of signal increase will depend on the TE and on the T2 value for the tissue being measured. The effect of PSF is also important. The wider PSF with ss-EPI improves SNR at the cost of resolution. This is partly offset in rs-EPI by a shorter TE, particularly for tissue with short T2. In addition to the ones mentioned above, there are many factors affecting SNR and CNR. It is hard to say in general whether they are higher for ss-EPI or rs-EPI, because it will depend on the exact protocol being used. The rs-EPI was developed with emphasis on reduced artifacts and sharper images, while maintain an acceptable SNR. A longer scan time has been mentioned as a drawback to the use of rs-EPI in the brain MRI. The rs-EPI is slower than ss-EPI by an amount that is approximately proportional to the number of readout segments used (8). However, in most applications, it is necessary to acquire multiple averages when using ss-EPI to achieve sufficient SNR, so the difference in scan time using the two sequences is much less than this, in practice. Indeed, in the scanning protocols used in our study, a slightly shorter scan time was used for the rs-EPI sequence: 2 minutes 47 seconds for ss-EPI and 2 minutes 31 seconds for rs-EPI. The first limitation of our study is that it was retrospective. Therefore, some acquisition parameters were not matched for the two DW images sequences. Secondly, our study subjects included only the malignant tumors with mass type lesion and most of them were invasive ductal carcinomas. Larger scale studies with non-mass type lesions and various histopathologic subtypes are required to prove the validity of high resolution DW images. Compared to a relatively consistent image quality in CE-MRI, there is a considerable difference in the level of image quality, from patient to patient, using both DW images techniques. This point restricts the practical application of DW images, and the reason was not identified in this study. Although the overall image quality is much better in rs-EPI, other factors including patient-related issues and the choice of acquisition parameters affect the image quality and should be further investigated. We demonstrated that the rs-EPI showed superior or equivalent image quality compared to ss-EPI in all categories. Anatomical structure distinction, delineation of the lesion, ghosting artifact, and overall image quality were significantly better in rs-EPI. Geometric distortion, SNR, and CNR were superior in rs-EPI as well. In this respect, rs-EPI is a useful alternative to ss-EPI in DW for evaluating breast pathology. We also expect the possibility of rs-EPI as screening sequence, which does not require the use of intravenous contrast agent. In conclusion, rs-EPI is superior to ss-EPI in the aspect of image quality in breast DW MR imaging. This work was based on a works-in-progress package provided by Siemens.

Loss of expression of SCRIB functions as a tumor suppressor in Drosophila and mammals, conversely, overexpression of SCRIB promotes epithelial differentiation in mammals. Here, we report that SCRIB is frequently amplified, mRNA over-expressed and protein is mislocalized from cell-cell junctions in human breast cancers. High levels of SCRIB mRNA are associated with poor clinical prognosis identifying an unexpected role for SCRIB in breast cancer. We find that, transgenic mice expressing a SCRIB mutant (Pro 305 to Leu (P305L)) that fails to localize to cell-cell junctions, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter, develop multifocal hyperplasia that progresses to highly pleomorphic and poorly differentiated tumors with basal characteristics. SCRIB interacts with PTEN and the expression of P305L, but not wild-type SCRIB, promotes an increase in PTEN levels in the cytosol. Overexpression of P305L, but not wild type SCRIB, activates the Akt/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway. Human breast tumors overexpressing SCRIB have high levels of S6K but do not harbor mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA, identifying SCRIB amplification as a mechanism of activating PI3K signaling in tumors without mutations in PIK3CA or PTEN. Thus, we demonstrate that high levels of mislocalized SCRIB functions as a neomorph to promote mammary tumorigenesis by affecting subcellular localization of PTEN and activating an Akt/mTOR/S6kinase signaling pathway.

Background A previous theoretic model (Tumour Biol 2013;34:1�7.) that breast tumor types differ in the relative rate of tissue invasion was elaborated and developed on a consecutive case series. Method Histologic data of 68 ductal breast cancer in situ (DCIS) and 1180 invasive ductal cancer (IDC) patients were collected and analyzed. Results ER+PgR? phenotype was more common in Luminal B2 than among the pooled Luminal A&B1 (p?=?0.0002), and more frequent in Luminal B1 than in Luminal A (p?=?0.0167). The same phenotype was associated with the age older than 54 years in Luminal B1 and in B2 patients. HER2 type cancers were more frequent in older patients (p?=?0.0038). Tumor progression from DCIS to IDC was found 39% faster than the average in Luminal B1 tumors, supporting the clinical importance of this tumor type. A rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2 type cancers (only 14% of HER2 type cancers) showed very slow transition to IDC (occurring at only 53.55% of average progression rate), while triple-negative cancers progressed faster than the average, despite Ki-67 value (104.63% for low and 114.27% for high Ki-67 tumors). In three tumor types with positive steroid receptors the ER+PgR? phenotype showed slower IDC transition than the ER+PgR+ phenotype of the same tumor type (difference in progression rate was 38% for Luminal A, 46% for Luminal B1 and 67% for Luminal B2 with Ki67?>?14%). Triple-negative tumors in younger patients exceeded the expected average progression rate by 24%, while in HER2 type tumors, the rate of tissue invasion was in younger patients 20% lower than the expected value. Conclusions The relative rate of tissue invasion differed substantialy among our patients. Differences depended on tumor types, steroid expression phenotypes and age. The dysfunctional ERs in the ER+PgR? phenotype showed slower rates of tissue invasion, suggesting that ligand binding to functional breast tumor ERs, beside promoting the PgR expression, possibly also promotes tumor transition to the invasive phase. In triple-negative tumors, an age dependent premenopausal mechanism possibly acted as an accelerator of tissue invasion, while faster tissue invasion by HER2-overexpressed tumors in older patients possibly depended on an unidentified mechanism that takes more time to be acquired, so it was less present in premenopausal patients. Introduction Ductal breast cancer in situ (DCIS) seems to precede invasive ductal cancer (IDC). This idea is based on a high degree of similarity between molecular alterations in DCIS and invasive cancer in the same patient [1,2], although triple-negative invasive cancers may seem almost to lack their triple-negative DCIS precursor [3-6]. If all breast cancer types evolve from DCIS lesions, more aggressive breast cancer types can be recognized by comparing breast tumor type distributions between DCIS lesions and invasive breast cancers [1]. The basic idea is that at the time of breast tumor diagnosis more aggressive tumor types will have fewer DCIS lesions in comparison to less aggressive types with more tumors still in the DCIS phase. This model, based on reported data of breast cancer characteristics pooled from several studies, was proposed in a recent theoretic article [1]. Differences in the incidences of the main breast cancer types (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-overexpressed and the triple-negative tumors) between DCIS and invasive ductal cancers (IDC) were used to calculate the relative rate of progression from the in situ stage to invasive form. This calculated value is probably not directly related to the course of disease. Instead, it was designed as a parameter that defines chances of a certain tumor to become invasive at the time of diagnoses. In other words, we were trying to indirectly measure the speed of the critical phase in breast cancer development. After becoming invasive, the future growth depends on many factors. For instance, HER2-overexpressed tumors were found in the theoretic model to be very slow in tissue invasion [1], although further development of HER2-overexpressed invasive breast cancers, is well known as aggressive and rapid. Triple-negative tumors showed in the pooled model the most rapid rate of tissue progression and this finding was interpreted as a sign of an unrecognized tumor progression mechanism, independent of steroid receptors or HER2 expression. Further to investigate the idea that immunohistochemical characteristics of IDC and of DCIS tumors from a defined single population can help us to describe biology of breast tumor types, a sufficiently large sample was required of DCIS and IDC patients with defined tumor types, ER, PgR, HER2 status and other histological features. The need for all these data comes from reported breast cancer studies [7-12] that suggested that PgR expression in cells with ER depends on estrogen exposure during previous days. In other words, ligand binding to functional ERs is a physiologic prerequisite for PgR expression in breast tumor cells. This clearly suggests that the three possible positive steroid receptor breast cancer phenotypes (ER+PgR+, ER+PgR? and the rare ER?PgR+) may be biologically different, particularly in this early phase of tumor growth, during tissue invasion. Without a suitably detailed published data set from a single population, the only solution was to use a single institution experience in diagnosing 68 DCIS and 1180 IDC patients that has already been attained as a part of an ongoing research project (219-2192382-2426), financed by the Croatian Ministry of Science. The aim of this study was to apply numeric methods described in the previous theoretic paper [1] on real patient data and thus get more reliable answers on the possible mechanisms underlying the occurrence of breast cancer types. Patients, materials and methods Patients Data used for the model testing were taken from the above mentioned ongoing research project (219-2192382-2426), approved by the Ethical Committee of Osijek Medical Faculty as compliant with the Helsinki Declaration, before grant submission to Croatian Ministry of Science and Education. In this study 1248 consecutive patients with intraductal and/or ductal invasive breast cancers (regardless of stage) were included. All patients were diagnosed and treated in Osijek Clinical Hospital during the time period from January 2004 to December 2012. All specimens were excisional biopsy specimens, or mastectomy specimens. 68 cases were DCIS alone. Tumor grade was determined using the Bloom and Richardson grading scheme [13]. Immunohistochemistry Each immunostained slide was evaluated for the presence of ER and PgR expression, HER2 protein overexpression, and Ki-67 proliferation activity. Immunohistochemical staining was done by standard avidin-biotin method (DAKO LSAB�2 System, HRP) using 4 ?m sections from representative paraffin blocks. Nuclear staining with anti-ER, PgR, Ki-67 antibodies was done and the percentage of positive cells per 500 tumor cells was calculated. Importantly, all ER+ and PgR+ cases showed staining in at least 1% of the DCIS and/or invasive tumor cell nuclei, whereas all ER-negative and PgR-negative cases showed complete absence of tumor cell staining (but with staining of normal breast epithelial cell nuclei) [14]. Tumor cells were considered positive for HER2 protein overexpression when more than 10% of the cells showed strong membrane staining (equivalent to a score of 3+ in the DakoCytomation HercepTest). "
Breast_Cancer "HER2 2+ result was only positive if confirmed by chromogene in situ hybridization for gene amplification. All immunostains were initially reviewed and scored by a single pathologist. Hormone receptors were then reviewed and accepted as negative if 100% of cells lacked nuclear immunostaining for hormone receptors. According to immunohistochemical features, tumors (both DCIS and invasive cancers) were divided into the following five groups: Luminal A (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2-negative, Ki-67?<?=14%), Luminal B1 (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2-negative, Ki-67?>?14%), Luminal B2 (ER+ and/or PgR+, HER2-positive, any Ki-67), HER2 (ER?, PgR?, HER2-positive), and triple-negative (ER?, PgR?, HER2-negative) [15]. Statistical analysis Collected data were organized in 2�2 tables and differences from expected frequencies were checked by ?2 tests. The relative rate of tissue invasion was calculated from a simple contingency table of DCIS and IDC data according to tumor types. The probability of tumor progression (p) at the time of diagnosis for each tumor type was calculated using the following equation: p = BC DCIS + BC where BC stands for the number of all invasive BCs for that tumor type, while DCIS is the reported number of DCIS lesions of that type. These results were used to calculate the number of progression t1/2 intervals spent prior the time of diagnosis using the following equation: t 1 / 2 = log 1 ? p log 1 / 2 where p is the calculated probability of progression for that tumor type. This interval is defined as a time required for 50% of DCIS lesions to become invasive. It was then converted into the relative rate (v rel ) using the following equation: v rel = tumor _ type _ t 1 / 2 average _ t 1 / 2 where tumor_type_t 1/2 is the number of elapsed t1/2 for a certain tumor type and average_t 1/2 is the number of elapsed intervals for all included breast tumors. The model predictions from the ref. 1 were recalculated for the modeled population with only 5% of DCIS at the time of diagnosis. This recalculation with a similar share of DCIS tumors allowed comparison between the model results and here presented data of our patients. Results Table 1 shows distributions of our patients regarding breast tumor type, ER & PgR expression, HER2 overexpression and age (younger than 55, or older than 54). Since the estrogen-dependent PgR expression occurs only in cells with functional ERs, the ER+PgR? tumors are considered expressing �dysfunctional� ERs.

In Luminal B1 and in B2 ER+PgR- tumors were more common in patients older than 54. HER2-overexpressed patients are often older than 54. Several comparisons were made and they can be summarized in the following statements: � Dysfunctional ER+PgR? phenotype was more common in Luminal B2 (38 out of 210 cases) in comparison to the pooled Luminal A&B1 (only 66 out of 743 cases), suggesting that this combination was more prevalent than expected in our patients (p?=?0.0002). � If Luminal A was compared with B1, high Ki-67 values in B1 are also more often combined with the ER+PgR? phenotype (40 out of 346 vs. 26 out of 397 cases, p?=?0.0167). Thus, tumors with either HER2 overexpression, or with increased Ki-67 values seemed prone to develop the dysfunctional ER+PgR? phenotype. � Age distributions were similar in the pooled Luminal A&B1 as in B2 (p?=?0.1260) suggesting that age and hormone exposure did not matter much in the tumor type differentiation between these two types. � If Luminal B2 tumors are divided according to Ki-67 value and steroid receptor phenotypes, no important differences were observed (p?=?0.5489), suggesting that distribution of steroid phenotypes and Ki-67 values remain unaltered in tumors with HER2 overexpression. � On the other hand, patients� age was not important for distribution of steroid receptor phenotypes only in Luminal A patients (p?=?0.3789). In Luminal B1 patients 34 out of 40 ER+PgR? tumors were detected in patients older than 54 years. Very similar distribution was observed in Luminal B2 patients with 34 out of 38 found in patients older than 54 years. A possible conclusion is that the ER+PgR? phenotype is more common in tumors with high Ki-67 values or with HER2 overexpression, particularly in older patients. � It is interesting that distribution of HER2-overexpressed tumor according to Ki-67 value and patients� age did not show any difference, and the same was found for triple-negative tumors. Nevertheless, if we compare age of HER2 versus triple-negative patients, HER2 patients are obviously often older than 54 years (94 out of 135 in comparison to 85 out of 160 triple-negative cases, p?=?0.0038). This suggests that HER2 tumors might be slower in the initial growth phase so they were more often diagnosed in older patients. Table 2 shows results of the model of ductal cancer progression from ref. 1, applied to patients in this study. For the comparison purpose only, data from ref. 1. were recalculated to simulate population of breast tumor patients with 5% of DCIS at the time of diagnosis. The recalculation was evidently well matched since the number of spent T1/2 of progression was very similar in presented data and in the recalculated simulated population (only above 4 t1/2 are spent in both data sets). Relative rates were calculated relative to the average progression rate of all tumors (the average count of spent t1/2 for all BC patients was 4.198), making the relative rates easily comparable: Table 2 Results of the ductal cancer progression model from ref. 1 , applied to here presented patients Ductal breast cancer (DC) types Ductal breast cancer types Total Luminal A Luminal B1 Luminal B2 HER2 + Triple-negative DCIS A 34 6 12 10 6 68 IDC B 363 340 198 125 154 1180 Number of all DC (A?+?B) C 397 346 210 135 160 1248 % of cancer types in all DC   31.81% 27.72% 16.83% 10.82% 12.82% 100.00% Probability of progression at the time of diagnosis (B/C) p 91.44% 98.27% 94.29% 92.59% 96.25% 94.55% Number of progression t1/2 spent till the time of diagnosis log(1-p)/log(1/2)   3.55 5.85 4.13 3.75 4.74 4.20 Relative rate of progression from DCIS to IDC   84.46% 139.35% 98.36% 89.45% 112.84% 100.00% Pooled reported DCIS and IDC data from ref. 1 Type Luminal A Luminal B HER2+ Triple-negative Total   DCIS 153 53 96 26 328   IDC 124 68 31 109 332   Total 277 121 127 135 660   Simulated population of all ductal breast cancer patients with 5% DCIS 2480.61 1329.43 677.90 2072.05 6560   % of cancer types in simulated population 37.81% 20.27% 10.33% 31.59% 100.00%   Probability of progression at the time of diagnosis 93.83% 96.01% 85.84% 98.75% 95.00%   Number of progression t1/2 spent till the time of diagnosis 4.02 4.65 2.82 6.32 4.32 The fastest in tissue invasion were Luminal B1 cancers and then the triple-negative cancers.

In ref. 1 Luminal B1 cancers were not separated from other Luminal A cancers, thus making triple-negative cancers the fastest in the relative tissue progression rate. As Luminal B1 cancers differ from Luminal A cancers only in Ki-67 values, the same threshold of 14% Ki-67 value was applied in Table 3 to Luminal B2, HER2-overexpressed and triple-negative cancers: Table 3 Relative tissue invasion rates according to the Ki-67 value Binary features DCIS IDC Relative rate Rate difference (positive�negative) ER Negative 16 290 1.0142 ?0.0186 Positive 52 890 0.9955 Total 68 1180 1.0000   PgR Negative 29 370 0.9010 0.1577 Positive 39 810 1.0587 Total 68 1180 1.0000   HER2 Negative 46 857 1.0231 ?0.0772 Positive 22 323 0.9459 Total 68 1180 1.0000   Ki-67 <=14% 43 451 0.8390 0.3317 >14 25 729 1.1707 Total 68 1180 1.0000   Ductal breast cancer types including Luminal B1 and proposed other Ki-67 subtypes Luminal A 34 363 0.8446 0.5489 Luminal B1 6 340 1.3936 Luminal B2 <=14% 4 54 0.9190 0.0929 >14% 8 144 1.0119 HER2 <=14% 4 15 0.5355 0.4824 >14% 6 110 1.0179 Triple-negative <=14% 1 20 1.0463 0.0964 >14% 5 134 1.1427 Total 68 1180 1.0000   Because Luminal B1 cancers differ from Luminal A cancers only by Ki-67 values, the same threshold of the 14% Ki-67 value was applied to Luminal B2, HER2-overexpressed and triple-negative cancers. Luminal B1 phenotype was 39% faster than average in progression. The rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2-overexpressed cancers (14% of HER2 cancers) showed very slow rate of transition to IDC (only 53.55% of the average rate). � Luminal B1 phenotype exceeded the average progression rate by 39%, supporting the clinical importance of this phenotype. The Ki-67 subtypes of Luminal B2 (proposed in this study), HER2-overexpressed and triple-negative cancers were not so impressive. � Low Ki-67 decreased the rate of Luminal B2 tissue progression (27% of Luminal B2 cancers showed 91.9% of the average progression rate). � A rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2-overexpressed cancers (14% of HER2 cancers) showed very slow rate of tissue invasion (only 53.55% of the average rate). � The triple-negative cancers progressed faster than the average rate, despite the Ki-67 value (104.63% for low and 114.27% for high Ki-67).

Breast_Cancer "All other features, including two steroid receptor phenotypes (ER+PgR+ and ER?PgR?) were not found to be dependent on age. These data suggest that tumor biology in two types of ER negative tumors (HER2-overexpressed and triple-negative tumors) was altered mainly in younger patients. The progression of triple-negative tumors was faster and of HER2-overexpressed tumors slower in younger patients. A possible interpretation regarding HER2-overexpressed tumors is that invasion in these tumors depends on an as yet unidentified mechanism that takes more time to be acquired. In triple-negative tumors, some age dependent mechanism accelerated tissue invasion in younger patients, but it seemed absent after the menopause. Thus, it is possible that we should be looking for another humoral factor, possibly related to ovulatory cycles, although not dependent on the presence of estrogen or progesterone receptors. Discussion This study started from a theoretic paper [1] that addressed several questions regarding tumor invasion into the breast tissue. As shown in previous sections of this paper, assembling a regionally limited case series of breast cancer patients allowed complex questions to be addressed. Several arguments can be drawn from the presented results. Among the pooled patients� results from ref. 1, Luminal A was found in near 38% of patients and triple-negative tumors in almost 32% of patients, Luminal B in 20% and HER2-overexpressed in 10% of patients. In our study, the share of triple-negative tumors was smaller (near 13%) while the pooled Luminal A & B1 (analogous to Luminal A in ref. 1) were found in almost 60% of all patients. These differences possibly reflected the improved sensitivity of ER and PgR detection by modern immunohistochemical staining and thus reduced the proportion of triple-negative cancers (from predicted 32% in simulated population to only 12.82% found among the presented cases). This suggests that many tumors among the pooled data from ref. 1., had been classified by the then contemporary immunohistochemical methods as triple-negative, while similar tumors among our patients possibly often met the criteria for Luminal B1 tumors. The dysfunctional ER+PgR? phenotype was more common in Luminal B2 in comparison to the pooled Luminal A&B1 tumors, and also more frequent in Luminal B1 than in Luminal A, suggesting that tumors with HER2 overexpression, or with increased Ki-67 values were in our patients linked to this phenotype with dysfunctional ERs. On the other hand, the same ER+PgR? phenotype among the three tumor types with positive steroid receptors showed slower tissue invasion than the ER+PgR+ phenotype of the same tumor type (progression rate differences by 38% for Luminal A, 46% for Luminal B1 and 67% for Luminal B2 with Ki67?>?14%). If the presence of functional ERs is so important for tissue invasion in several breast tumor types, a plausible question is whether the efficacy of conventional hormonal therapy is compromised in patients with dysfunctional ERs (those patients with the ER+PgR? tumor phenotype). Tumor progression from DCIS to IDC was found to exceed the average rate by 39% in Luminal B1 tumors, supporting the clinical importance of this tumor type. A rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2 type cancers showed very slow tissue invasion (only 53.55% of the average rate). Triple-negative cancers showed tissue progression rates above the average, regradless of the Ki-67 value (104.63% for the low and 114.27% for the high Ki-67 tumors). These findings suggest that high Ki-67 values might be used as a surrogate marker of an as yet unrecognized invasion promoting mechanisms in breast tumor types, except among the triple-negative cancers. When considering age of patients and the relative rate of tissue invasions, breast tumors with the dysfunctional ER+PgR? phenotype progressed faster in younger patients and 33% slower than expected in older patients. Triple-negative tumors in younger patients were 24% faster than the expected average, while in HER2-overexpressed tumors, the rate of tumor invasion in younger patients was 20% lower than the expected value. A possible interpretation regarding HER2-overexpressed tumors is that invasion in these tumors depends on an unidentified mechanism that takes more time to be acquired. In triple-negative tumors, an age dependent premenopausal mechanism possibly accelerates tissue invasion without binding to ERs or PgRs (possibly activin/inhibin [16-18] or some other). Conclusions A previously developed theoretic model, from the pooled published breast cancer data [1], suggested that all breast cancer types evolve from DCIS lesions. If so, the more tissue invasive breast cancer types can be recognized by comparing breast tumor type distributions between DCIS lesions and invasive breast cancers, through calculation of the relative rate of tissue invasion. By using the same approach on a case series from a single institution, the following complex results were obtained: � Among our patients, the share of DCIS tumors was only 5.45% of all breast cancer cases, probably reflecting late detection of breast tumors in our population. � The fastest tissue invasion was observed among luminal B1 cancers, supporting the clinical importance of this phenotype and suggesting that the tissue invasion rate of Luminal B1 tumors depends on high Ki-67 value. � The subgroup of 301 patients with the ER+PgR+ phenotype of Luminal B1 tumors showed even a higher rate of tumor invasion. Beside that in all three tumor types with positive steroid receptors (Luminal A, B1 and B2), the dysfunctional ERs in the ER+PgR? phenotype showed slower rates of tissue invasion. These results suggest that ligand binding to functional breast tumor ERs, beside promoting the PgR expression, possibly also promotes tumor transition to the invasive phase. � The rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2-overexpressed cancers (14% of HER2 cancers) showed very slow rate of tissue invasion. This suggests that the phenotype with low Ki-67 in HER2 type cancers might be recognized as a subgroup that longer remain in the DCIS phase at the time of diagnosis than any other cancer types. The tested model was focused on the very early breast tumor growth phase that leads to tissue invasion, so these results are not necessary important for the subsequent clinical course of invasive ductal cancer. Nevertheless, an investigation into whether the here described subgroups also show differences in subsequent phases of cancer growth or in treatment responses seem warranted.

Breast_Cancer "Practical preventive methods to reduce risk of breast cancer are lacking. Few studies have investigated the effects of carotenoids and isoflavones on circulating adipokines in postmenopausal women. Objective: The aim was to examine the effects of lycopene- and isoflavone-rich diets on serum adipokines. Design: This was a 26-week, two-arm, longitudinal crossover trial. Setting: Participants were recruited from clinics at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants: Seventy postmenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk participated in the study. The mean age and body mass index of participants was 57.2 years and 30.0 kg/m2, respectively; the study was comprised of 81.4% whites. Interventions: The interventions included 10 weeks of consumption of a tomato-based diet (?25 mg lycopene daily) and 10 weeks of consumption of a soy-based diet (?40 g of soy protein daily), with a 2-week washout in between. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in serum adiponectin, leptin, and the adiponectin to leptin ratio were examined for each intervention through linear mixed models, with ratio estimates corresponding to postintervention adipokine concentrations relative to preintervention concentrations. Results: After the tomato intervention, among all women, adiponectin concentration increased (ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00�1.18), with a stronger effect observed among nonobese women (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.02�1.25). After the soy intervention, adiponectin decreased overall (ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.84�0.97), with a larger reduction observed among nonobese women (ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.81�0.98). Overall, no significant changes in leptin or the adiponectin to leptin ratio were observed after either intervention. Conclusions: Increasing dietary consumption of tomato-based foods may beneficially increase serum adiponectin concentrations among postmenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk, especially those who are not obese. Additional studies are essential to confirm these effects and to elucidate the specific mechanisms that may make phytonutrients found in tomatoes practical as breast cancer chemopreventive agents.

Methylation alterations of CpG islands, CpG island shores and first exons are key events in the formation and progression of human cancer, and an increasing number of differentially methylated regions and genes have been identified in breast cancer. Recent studies of the breast cancer methylome using deep sequencing and microarray platforms are providing a novel insight on the different roles aberrant methylation plays in molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Accumulating evidence from a subset of studies suggests that promoter methylation of tumor-suppressor genes associated with breast cancer can be quantified in circulating DNA. However, there is a paucity of studies that examine the combined presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with breast cancer using blood-based assays. Dysregulation of DNA repair capacity (DRC) is a genetic risk factor for breast cancer that has been measured in lymphocytes. We isolated plasma DNA from 340 participants in a breast cancer case control project to study promoter methylation levels of five genes previously shown to be associated with breast cancer in frozen tissue and in cell line DNA: MAL, KIF1A, FKBP4, VGF and OGDHL. Methylation of at least one gene was found in 49% of the cases compared to 20% of the controls. Three of the four genes had receiver characteristic operator curve values of ?0.50: MAL (0.64), KIF1A (0.51) and OGDHL (0.53). KIF1A promoter methylation was associated with breast cancer and inversely associated with DRC. This is the first evidence of a significant association between genetic and epigenetic alterations in breast cancer using blood-based tests. The potential diagnostic utility of these biomarkers and their relevance for breast cancer risk prediction should be examined in larger cohorts. epigenetics epigenetic biomarker panel breast cancer KIF1A OGDHL FKBP4 VGF MAL promoter methylation DNA repair capacity Introduction According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.2 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) this year. Worldwide, the incidence of BC is increasing by 3.1% annually (1980 to 2010 statistics) (1). BC is the most common malignancy in women, accounting for 23% of all female malignancies (2,3). BC is also the leading cause of cancer-related death among Puerto Rican women. Data from the Puerto Rico Cancer Registry show that BC accounted for 30.3% of all female cancers between 2005 and 2009 and 18.8% of all female cancer-related deaths between 2004 and 2008 (4). Mammography�s limitations in early detection of BC have been documented, particularly in women with pre-menopausal BC (5). BC is a complex disease resulting from a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors (6). Aberrant promoter methylation of several known or putative tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) occurs frequently during the pathogenesis of human cancer, including BC. Methylated TSGs are promising biomarkers for cancer screening that can be measured in plasma (7,8). Similarly, dysregulation of DNA repair pathways predisposes cells to accumulating damage and eventually mutations. Epidemiological studies using functional repair assays in lymphocytes or other cell types have demonstrated that DNA repair capacity (DRC) varies greatly among individuals and that a low repair capacity is a significant risk factor for the development of several types of cancers, including BC (9,10). Our previous studies have shown that a low DRC is an important risk factor for BC in Puerto Rican women (11,12). Few studies have examined the combined contribution of genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with BC using blood-based assays. To test the association of MAL, KIF1A, FKBP4, VGF, and OGDHL promoter methylation with BC, we obtained plasma DNA from 340 participants in a case-control BC study (9). Since women with BC in this cohort have an average decrease of 60% in their DCR levels we also performed a subset analysis to examine the association between promoter methylation of MAL, KIF1A, FKBP4 and OGDHL and DRC levels. Materials and methods Study design Plasma DNA from 340 participants, randomly selected from an incident-case case-control study of 1,186 Puerto Rican resident women representing ~83% of the island�s municipalities (counties) was obtained after IRB approval from the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The participants were selected with the random selection subroutine of SPSS: Select Cases, Random Sample of Cases (IBM SPSS, version 22; Chicago IL, USA). Study population All participants were female residents of Puerto Rico, recruited primarily from private practice offices of oncologists, gynecologists and surgeons in the cities of San Juan, Ponce, Salinas and Yauco. The age of the participants ranged from 30 to 89 years. A total of 502 BC cases and 684 controls, prospectively recruited over 7 years (2006 to 2013), were included in the original study sample (11). Cases were women with a diagnosis of primary BC recruited consecutively from individuals visiting gynecological and primary care medical offices in Puerto Rico. The inclusion criteria for cases were as follows: patients who were recently diagnosed with primary BC, confirmed by histopathology and not receiving chemotherapy, blood transfusions, or radiotherapy. Patients with BC secondary to other types of cancer were not included. The pathology report from each case was reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Controls were women without BC recruited consecutively from individuals visiting gynecological and primary care medical offices in Puerto Rico for their routine mammograms and other types of wellness screenings. The two inclusion criteria for controls were: have a normal clinical breast examination performed by their primary physicians and normal mammogram result, both no more than six months prior to enrollment. Controls were recruited from the same population (clinics, physician offices and hospitals) where the cases came from; if they were to eventually develop BC, they would be treated in the same clinics where the cases were recruited. These selection criteria minimized selection bias. Women with BC secondary to another type of cancer were excluded from the present study. BC patients and controls completed informed consent and HIPAA forms, as well as a self-administered questionnaire. The seven-page epidemiological questionnaire was used to gather epidemiological information on risk factors in relation to family history, genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors. The characteristics of study participants including age, body mass index (BMI), family history of BC, age of menopause, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, consumption of multivitamins and DRC are summarized in Table I. DNA methylation analysis DNA from 340 participants was extracted from 500 ?l of plasma. Genomic DNA from 280 (81%) patients had 260/280 ratios >1.7 and amplified ?-actin, thus meeting our stringent QC filter. We randomly divided the participants into a discovery set (20 cases and 20 controls) and a validation set (154 cases and 86 controls). Briefly, bisulfite-modified DNA was used as template for fluorescence-based real-time PCR, as previously described (13). Fluorogenic PCR reactions were carried out in a reaction volume of 20 ml consisting of 600 nmol/l of each primer; 200 mmol/l probe; 0.75 units Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen); 200 mmol/l each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP; 200 nmol/l ROX dye reference (Invitrogen); 16.6 mmol/l ammonium sulfate; 67 mmol/l Trizma (Sigma); 6.7 mmol/l magnesium chloride; 10 mmol/l mercaptoethanol; and 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Duplicates of 3 ml of bisulfite-modified DNA solution were used in each real-time MSP amplification reaction. Primers and probes were designed to amplify a segment of a CpG island in the promoter of the genes of interest and of a reference gene, ?-actin (ACTB), as previously described. Primers and probes were tested on positive (genomic methylated bisulfite converted DNA) and negative controls (genomic unmethylated bisulfite converted DNA) to ensure amplification of the desired product and non-amplification of unmethylated DNA, respectively. Primer and probe sequences and annealing temperatures are provided in Table II. Amplification reactions were carried out in 384-well plates in a 7900 Sequence Detector (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and were analyzed by SDS 2.2.1 (Sequence Detector System; Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling was initiated with an initial denaturation step at 95�C for 3 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95�C for 15 sec and annealing temperature for 1 min. Each plate included patient DNA samples, positive (bisulfite converted hypermethylated universal DNA standard; Zymo Research), and multiple water blanks as non-template controls. Serial dilutions (60-0.006 ng) of this DNA were used to construct a calibration curve for each plate. The relative level of methylated DNA for each gene in each sample was determined as a ratio of qMSP for the amplified gene to ACTB and then multiplied by 100 for easier tabulation. The samples were categorized as unmethylated or methylated based on detection of methylation above a threshold set for each gene. Statistical analysis Data were entered and compiled in the SPSS� 22 statistical package (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), following a standardized procedure to verify the data and correct for sample gaps or errors. Frequency distribution and cross-tabulation of selected variables were used to initially explore crude data, to evaluate the crude associations of each gene methylation value (along with other covariates) in regard to BC and DRC, and to explore the feasibility of further data analysis of each variable under study. Methylation values were first analyzed as continuous variables and were also dichotomized into �methylated and not methylated� using a cut-off identified by area under the curve (AUC) analyses (14,15). Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were used to examine the association between promoter methylation, BC and DRC levels, which were previously measured in this cohort with the host cell reactivation assay and using a luciferase reporter gene (11). In addition, the associations of all covariates with each gene methylation as compared to no methylation were an integral part of the analysis. After transforming continuous variables to approximate normality, we used the mean difference (differential methylation) to compare BC and control data. Mean differences in promoter methylation were also compared along high and low DRC levels. The 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the precision of the mean difference, and the Wilcoxon test was used to assess the statistical significance of the mean differences since the distribution of some of these variables was unknown or skewed. For categorical variables, the odds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of association, with a 95% confidence interval as an assessment of the precision of this estimate. The two-tailed Fisher�s exact test was calculated to measure the statistical significance of the crude OR. We also explored confounding and interaction effects to establish associations between promoter methylation and BC, DRC level (low <4.97%; high ?4.97%), and other covariates by means of the Mantel and Hansel stratified analysis. We used multiple logistic regressions to measure the adjusted OR and analyze possible interactions."

We have assessed a new highly sensitive AMH assay (Ansh picoAMH) in the evaluation of ovarian activity in women with very low ovarian reserve after chemotherapy. Methods A prospective cohort and an independent validation cohort of premenopausal women with early breast cancer (eBC) were recruited at the time of diagnosis (combined n = 98), and ovarian reserve markers 2�5 years later following chemotherapy were assessed in relation to menstrual activity. Results The picoAMH assay had a limit of detection of 7.5 pg/ml. AMH clearly distinguished women with ongoing menses from those with amenorrhoea at 2 years after diagnosis (mean 522 � 169 versus 8.9 � 1.3 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) with high predictive value for continuing menses or amenorrhoea for the subsequent 3 years. AMH was detectable in more women than using a previous assay (P = 0.004). Other markers of the ovarian reserve (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B) were also of discriminatory value but to lesser extents. This finding was validated in a second, independent cohort of women treated for eBC. Conclusion The 10-fold increased assay sensitivity showed very clear distinction between groups based on ovarian activity with excellent prediction of future menses or amenorrhoea. This will improve assessment of post-chemotherapy ovarian function in women and may aid treatment decisions. Keywords AMH Breast cancer Ovarian function Chemotherapy Ovarian reserve 1 Introduction Adjuvant chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment of early breast cancer (eBC) as it results in an improvement in both disease-free and overall survival rate [1]. Breast cancer survivors in their reproductive age are now confronted with the long-term consequences of exposure to these treatments, and therefore quality of life issues including fertility are becoming more important. Chemotherapeutic agents can have a profound impact on ovarian function. They cause a depletion of the follicle pool in a drug- and dose-dependent manner [2]. Many women become amenorrhoeic during or after chemotherapy and chemotherapy-related amenorrhoea (CRA) is often seen as a sign of ovarian failure [3,4]. Recovery of menses in some women after chemotherapy illustrates the limitation of amenorrhoea as a marker of complete loss of the ovarian reserve; conversely the resumption of menses may be only brief indicating preservation of only a very low ovarian reserve. Anti-M�llerian hormone (AMH) is becoming established as a biochemical marker of ovarian reserve [5�7]. It has been shown to be more sensitive than inhibin B and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and ultrasound markers antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume in assessing chemotherapy-induced ovarian follicle loss [8]. AMH concentrations showed a rapid and marked fall during chemotherapy, with undetectable concentrations in many women after chemotherapy using the currently available assays [8�13]. AMH is also undetectable for several years before the menopause in normal women [14�17]. Thus current assays are unable to detect AMH in women with very low ovarian reserve, inadequately distinguishing such women from those without the likelihood of future ovarian activity. The diagnosis of ovarian failure has important therapeutic implications as well as for fertility, sexual health and non-reproductive e.g. bone health [18�20], thus its early and reliable diagnosis is central to the ongoing management of women with breast and other cancers. Endocrine therapy is often used after chemotherapy in women with eBC and may complicate interpretation of conventional diagnosis of ovarian failure, thus markers of ovarian function which are more independent of such therapies are required [18]. The main objective of this study was to investigate the value of a highly sensitive AMH assay in the assessment of ovarian function after chemotherapy in women with eBC, in comparison with other current markers of the ovarian reserve. 2 Patients and methods Two cohorts of premenopausal women with eBC were recruited from the Edinburgh Breast Unit to a 5-year prospective study of ovarian function (n = 56 and n = 42, respectively). All had operable breast cancer and reported regular menses in the absence of hormonal contraception. Patients were recruited to the study after giving informed consent, usually before undergoing definitive loco-regional surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for their breast cancer. The first cohort was used to assess the main study questions, and the second for validation. Chemotherapy regimens for these women have been previously described and consisted of sequential anthracycline-CMF or anthracyclines and taxanes in most [21,22] with 14 women in cohort 1 not given any chemotherapy; therapeutic decisions were not influenced by this study. Both studies received Ethics Committee approval. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The proportions of women receiving endocrine therapy did not differ between groups in either cohort. Patients were evaluated at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after initial diagnosis of breast cancer in cohort 1, and after 1 and 3 years in cohort 2. Visits were scheduled to be in the early follicular phase (D2-5) if appropriate. Menstrual data were coded as amenorrhoea when there was no menstrual bleeding in the preceding 6 months, as transient amenorrhoea when there was return of menses after a period of amenorrhoea, or as having ongoing menses throughout treatment up till the time of analysis. AMH was assayed using the Ansh labs pico-AMH ELISA kit (Ansh Catalog no. AL-124, Webster, TX). For comparison with previous assays, serum samples taken at 2 years in cohort 1 also analysed using the Active MIS/AMH ELSIA (Beckman Coulter, Chaska, MN), sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml [21]. FSH was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [23], and both intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 8%. Inhibin B was measured as previously described [24], with sensitivity 7.8 pg/ml; intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 5% and 8%, respectively. Estradiol was measured by ELISA (Demeditec, Kiel-Wellsee, Germany) with coefficients of variation <8%. 2.1 Statistical analyses Data are presented as mean � sem. The primary analysis was comparison of hormone concentrations versus menstrual function at 2 years post diagnosis, with groups compared by ANOVA; in longitudinal analyses timepoints were compared to data at 2 years using Dunn�s posthoc test. Proportions of women were compared using Fisher�s exact test. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20). A two-tailed value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Assay characteristics The lower limit of detection (LLOD: the lowest concentration of AMH in a sample that can be detected with a 95% probability) was determined by serial dilution of pooled patient serum in two different assay plates. The LLOD was 7.5 pg/ml, in agreement with the manufacturer�s quoted range of 1.7�11.6 pg/ml. Inter-assay analytical variation (CV) was 5.6% at 67.7 pg/ml and 2.0% at 185 pg/ml. Intra-assay analytical variation was less than 10% from 25 pg/ml to 783 pg/ml. 3.2 Menses after chemotherapy Amongst the 56 women recruited to the initial cohort, 39 in the chemotherapy group and 14 in the non-chemotherapy group remained in the study at 2 years, the key time point for analysis; the remaining three women had either withdrawn from the study because of disease recurrence or had discontinued follow-up after hysterectomy and oophorectomy. The majority of patients enrolled in this study received a combination chemotherapy regimen that incorporated cyclophosphamide, an anthracycline and a taxane, as previously described [21]. The 39 women who had chemotherapy were subdivided into three groups according to their menstrual pattern over the 2�5 year followup period: ongoing menses (n = 10), transient amenorrhoea (n = 4), and amenorrhoea (n = 25). Ages of these groups are shown in Table 1. Women with ongoing menses were younger than women who were amenorrhoeic (P < 0.05) and the no chemotherapy group (P < 0.05); the age of the transient amenorrhoea group was not significantly different to the others. 3.3 Reproductive hormones after chemotherapy Serum concentrations of all hormones (AMH, inhibin B, estradiol, and FSH) at 2 years by menstrual function are shown in Fig. 1. 3.3.1 Anti-M�llerian hormone AMH clearly discriminated between groups being detectable in all women with ongoing menses, and undetectable in most women with amenorrhoea (Fig. 1), mean at 2 years 522 � 169 [range 12�1425 pg/ml] versus 8.9 � 1.3 pg/ml [all <39.6 pg/ml], P < 0.0001. This marked difference was sustained with very similar data at 3, 4 and 5 years with a non-significant decline in AMH through follow-up (Fig. 2). Overall, AMH was undetectable in only one woman at a single time point in those with continuing menses, whereas it was undetectable in 81 of 100 samples in the amenorrhoeic group. Mean AMH was also higher in the ongoing menses group than in the transient amenorrhoea group (P < 0.05) but was not different to the no chemotherapy group (P < 0.05). In the groups with ongoing menses and the no chemotherapy group (i.e. excluding the two amenorrhoeic groups), the rate of detection of AMH in women using the picoAMH assay was higher than using a previous generation assay (20 versus 12 of 24 women; P = 0.004). Women whose menses returned after a period of amenorrhoea showed a low but variable pattern of AMH concentrations. Two women with undetectable AMH at 2 years showed some recovery during followup, to concentrations of 55 and 63 pg/ml at 5 years. One of the women with detectable AMH at 2 years showed a fluctuating pattern, with AMH becoming undetectable at 3 and 4 years, but a higher value at 5 years (145 pg/ml versus 61 pg/ml at 2 years). In the other woman AMH was close to the limit of detection at 3 years and was undetectable at 4 and 5 years. 3.3.2 Inhibin B Inhibin B concentrations were very low throughout the period of investigation in all groups (Fig. 1) and while it tended to be higher in women with continuing menses, it was undetectable in 5 of 10 of them and there were no significant differences between groups. 3.3.3 Estradiol Estradiol concentrations mirrored menstrual pattern, separating women with and without menses (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1). "
Breast_Cancer "The transient amenorrhoea group, although small, showed comparable patterns to that seen with AMH. One woman with initially detectable then declining AMH showed a similar profile for E2, and a woman with initially undetectable but then rising AMH had parallel changes in E2. Women in the no chemotherapy group showed fluctuating E2 concentrations, which were not significantly different from either the ongoing menses or amenorrhoeic groups, nor did they vary significantly with time. 3.3.4 Follicle-stimulating hormone FSH concentrations were markedly higher in women with persistent amenorrhoea than in the group with ongoing menses (P = 0.0001; Fig. 1). These differences were observed at all time points up to 5 years, with no significant changes in FSH concentrations in either of those two groups over that period (Fig. 2). The transient amenorrhoea group showed low FSH concentrations at 2 years but marked variability (without statistically significant differences) at subsequent time points. The no chemotherapy group showed similar FSH concentrations to the ongoing menses group at 2 years but showed a significant rise with time (P = 0.02). 3.4 Discriminatory value of ovarian markers The ability of the various hormones to discriminate between women with and without menses was assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using data at 2 years (Fig. 3). These gave areas under the curve (AUC) values of 0.99 for AMH (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.97�1.01, P < 0.0001, peak likelihood ratio (LR) 9.6), 0.93 for E2 (CI 0.83�1.03, P < 0.0001, peak LR 9.6), 0.74 for inhibin B (CI 0.54�0.94, P = 0.03, peak LR 2.1) and 0.86 for FSH (CI 0.73�0.98, P = 0.001, peak LR 7.2). The optimum cut-off for AMH was 16.1 pg/ml, giving a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 90%. As this value is close to the limit of detection of the assay, this result means that a woman with detectable AMH using this assay is very likely to have ongoing menses for at least 3 years thereafter whereas a woman with undetectable AMH does indeed have no remaining ovarian reserve and will remain amenorrhoeic. Including data from the women with transient amenorrhoea with those with ongoing menses only slightly reduced the AUC for AMH to 0.97 (peak LR 6.7) and for E2 to 0.86 (both P < 0.001), whereas the AUC for inhibin B was reduced to 0.65 and became not significant; AUC for FSH increased slightly to 0.87 (P = 0.0001). 3.5 Validation cohort analysis These findings were assessed in a second cohort of 42 women with eBC following treatment with chemotherapy followed up for 3 years as described above. 31 were amenorrhoeic by 1 year and remained so, eight showed continuing menses at 1 year, and 3 were amenorrhoeic at 1 year but had recovered menses by 3 years (Table 1). AMH concentrations were markedly different in the two groups, mean values 20-fold higher in the women with ongoing menses than in the amenorrhoea group (P = 0.0001; Fig. 4). AMH was detectable in all women with menses at 1 year and remained so at 3 years; while it was close to the limit of detection in two women (<20 pg/ml) both had higher concentrations at 3 years (46 and 155 pg/ml) indicating ongoing recovery from the effect of chemotherapy. In contrast, AMH was undetectable in 23 of the 31 amenorrhoeic women at 1 year and very low (<20 pg/ml) in a further 4. Three women showed return of menses between 1 and 3 years of followup. All had detectable AMH concentrations at 1 year, and showed marked rises in AMH at 3 years (29�567, 750�1405 and 58�357 pg/ml) although these levels remained very low considering these women�s age (38, 28 and 29 years, respectively). Overall mean AMH in women with menses at 3 years was higher than in the same women at 1 year (558 � 196 versus 354 � 170 pg/ml, P = 0.02, n = 8). 4 Discussion In this prospective study, we examined a panel of reproductive hormones of ovarian function including AMH, inhibin B, FSH, and estradiol in eBC survivors, and used a highly sensitive AMH assay to evaluate the ovarian reserve in this group of patients. We demonstrate significant differences in AMH, FSH and estradiol between women with amenorrhoea compared with those who continued to menstruate at 2�5 years after diagnosis. This is concordant in results with previous data in which AMH, FSH and estradiol were found to differ between menstruating and amenorrhoeic women at 1�4 years after chemotherapy [25] although the proportions of women with undetectable AMH were not shown. That study also suggested a significant difference in inhibin B level, not confirmed in the present data. These data thus confirm the value AMH as a marker of ovarian reserve in this context. This study also evaluated the predictive potential of these markers for determining future menstrual status. AMH was consistently detectable in those with ongoing menses and had the highest predictive value by ROC analysis. An undetectable level of AMH using this ultrasensitive assay at 2 years followup suggests that menstruation is unlikely to resume whereas a detectable AMH level suggests that ongoing menstruation is very likely for at least 3 years thereafter. This contrasts with this and previous studies using less sensitive assays which have identified populations of women with evidence of ovarian function but undetectable AMH [26,27]. For those women who are pre-menopausal at diagnosis of an oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, this information would be very helpful in the clinic. There is good evidence that the sequence of an aromatase inhibitor after tamoxifen gives superior outcomes to continuing with tamoxifen, but in women with functioning ovaries, aromatase inhibitors are ineffective so there is always concern about switching such patients [28,29]. Therefore patients could be treated with tamoxifen initially after completion of chemotherapy, and if at 2 years still had detectable AMH, a switch to an aromatase inhibitor would not be appropriate, whereas it would be for those with undetectable AMH concentrations. The lack of effect of tamoxifen on AMH [30] supports this approach. Women who show recovery of menses after amenorrhoea are an important group in this context, although they were infrequent in both cohorts studied here and including them with those with ongoing menses made little difference to the discriminatory ability of AMH. They had variably detectable AMH concentrations, and larger groups of these women are needed to assess the value of AMH in them. A substantial proportion of young women retain ovarian activity after modern adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer [4]. Menstruation is a poor indicator of fertility potential, but the limited data indicate that women who retain ovarian function after chemotherapy can often conceive [31,32], probably reflecting their young age. In normal young women, low AMH is not associated with reduced fecundity [33]. Their reproductive lifespan may however be markedly reduced, and AMH may be of value to detect that and predict remaining duration of potential fertility. In women with ongoing menstruation AMH was generally very low (522 � 169 pg/ml at 2 years) for their age (mean 35 years), and similar to the no-chemotherapy group whose mean age was 45 years. These data highlight the risk of early menopause even in those with ongoing menses several years after chemotherapy [34]; such women may also be at increased risk of post treatment infertility [35]. There are a paucity of data linking post-treatment AMH to the clinically important variables of reproductive lifespan and fertility but the development of new assays able to detect low levels of AMH may allow further research to explore these relationships. The present analyses are limited particularly by the numbers of patients included, and by the inclusion only of women with breast cancer. The number of women who showed recovery of menses after amenorrhoea was small and it would be valuable to increase this group although this is a feature of the age related incidence of breast cancer and the current use of alkylating agent based chemotherapy. It is unclear whether this approach will be of value in relation to other diagnoses and treatments. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the value of a more sensitive AMH assay in assessing ovarian function after chemotherapy, and predicting ovarian activity over the following years. The improved sensitivity of this assay also highlights the profound loss of ovarian reserve in these women. Although these data require further validation, the measurement of AMH post chemotherapy may offer valuable information to both patients and their clinicians.

Breast_Cancer "The efficacy of [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was assessed using a xenograft model of breast cancer developed by injection of MCF-7 cells in the flank of BALB/c nude mice. Treatment of solid tumor-bearing mice with [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] induced up to 50% reduction of tumor mass compared with an average 10% inhibition recorded in cisplatin-treated animals. Thus, chemotherapy with [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was much more effective than cisplatin. We also demonstrated enhanced in vivo pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and tolerability of [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] when compared with cisplatin administered in Wistar rats. Pharmacokinetics studies with [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] revealed prolonged Pt persistence in systemic blood circulation and decreased nefrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, major target sites of cisplatin toxicity. Overall, [Pt(O,O?-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] turned out to be extremely promising in terms of greater in vivo anticancer activity, reduced nephrotoxicity and acute toxicity compared with cisplatin. anticancer agents breast cancer pharmacokinetic cisplatin Pt(II)-analogs Despite the ubiquitous use of cisplatin in oncology, this drug is associated with significant dose-limiting toxicities including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. There is correspondingly a clear incentive to develop new strategies for safer and more effective cisplatin therapy. In this context, new platinum(II) complexes containing acetylacetonate (acac) in the coordination sphere of the metal have been designed and synthesized by some of us: [PtCl(O,O'-acac)(DMSO)] with only one oxygen-bonded (O,O'-acac) acac, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMSO)] containing both an O,O'-acac and a ?-bonded (?-carbon bonded) acac, their dimethylsulphide (DMS) analogs having the same key structures.1, 2 The ability of these new Pt(II) compounds to induce cell death in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, in human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and in primary cultured human breast epithelial cells has been characterized and compared with the well-established anticancer drug, cisplatin.3, 4, 5 Among them, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] exhibited the highest in vitro activity from the panel of platinum(II) complexes evaluated.3 In addition, the reactivity of these novel complexes with nucleobases and sulfur ligands suggests that the mechanisms that underlie their cytotoxic activity may not necessarily require reaction with DNA.3 Interestingly, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] passes the blood-brain barrier and reaches the central nervous system in doses much higher than cisplatin. Nevertheless, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] displayed a low cytotoxicity in normal tissue, certainly less important than the neurotoxicity caused by cisplatin.6 The higher and selective cytotoxicity of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] toward the cancer cell observed in immortalized cell lines of the breast was confirmed in breast cancer cells in primary cultures.4, 5 The [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] produces apoptotic effects at concentrations lower than cisplatin, whose undesirable side effects continue to limit its effectiveness. The selectivity of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] effects, stimulates a more detailed study aimed at pre-clinical investigation of its therapeutic potential in vivo. Results In vivo toxicity We examined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of various doses of cisplatin or [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] after a single intravenous injection in female athymic mice. The MTD was estimated based on the threshold at which all animals survived, as shown in the Kaplan�Meier survival curve. In the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] group, mice receiving doses up to 50?mg/kg tolerated the dose, but three of five mice and all five mice, respectively, in the 100 and 120?mg/kg groups died (Figure 1a). Only a dose of 20?mg/kg of cisplatin was tolerated by the athymic mice, but they had significant weight loss, whereas those receiving lower doses did not (Figure 1b). We therefore conclude that the MTD for [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] is 50?mg/kg and that of cisplatin is 20?mg/kg. To further define the MTD, in the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] group, the overall toxicity as revealed by body weights was monitored over 28 days; mice receiving 5?mg/kg, 10 and 20?mg/kg [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] showed normal weight gain (Figure 1c). During the observation period, no deterioration in health was observed in mice treated with 5?mg/kg and 10?mg/kg [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)], and the overall behavior was no different compared with that observed for untreated animals. The [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated mice did not develop significant polyuria, as in cisplatin-treated mice (0.85�0.1?ml/24?h and 2.8�0.5?ml/24?h [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] versus cisplatin, P<0.05). The comparative tissue distributions of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin were studied by measuring Pt content after a single intravenous dose. [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] showed a very similar distribution pattern to that typically exhibited by Pt compounds including cisplatin, the maximum concentration of Pt occurring in the kidney, liver and spleen. The highest Pt concentration was found after 30 days (Figure 1d). Statistical analyses of these data were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test, P<0.05 (compared with control). [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft murine model We studied the efficacy of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] using a xenograft model of breast cancer developed by injection of MCF-7 cells in the flank of BALB/c nude mice. After tumors had grown to ?100?mm3, the mice were randomized into five groups in such a manner as to minimize weight and tumor size differences among the groups. After administering a single intravenous of saline as a control, or two doses (5 and 10?mg/kg) of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] or cisplatin, the tumor volumes of BALB/c mice were measured by a vernier calliper every 3 days for 30 days in total. The average tumor volumes of each group were calculated and tumor growth curves were drawn as usual. Statistical analysis was carried out using variance analysis and Student's t-test, and differences were considered significant where P<0.05. Over the course of 30 days, the average tumor volume increased from 98,50 �34.27 to 249.32�43.97?mm3 for the saline group, 233.67�50.71?mm3 for the cisplatin group (10?mg/kg; P>0.05), 168.32�40.23?mm3 for the group treated with 5?mg/kg of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] (P<0.05) and 115.12�38.05?mm3 for the group treated with 10?mg/kg of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] (P<0.05) (Figure 2). Thus, the results indicate that 10?mg/kg [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was more effective than 10?mg/kg cisplatin over the first 12 days. Biodistribution and excretion in vivo The distribution and excretion of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin were also investigated in male Sprague Dawley rats, following intravenous administration of the MTDs of the compounds. Biodistribution of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] after intravenous administration was determined by measuring platinum concentrations in plasma, whole blood and peripheral tissues at different time (Figure 3). Consistent with previous reports,7, 8 free cisplatin disappeared rapidly from circulation, with only about 9% of the injected dose detectable in plasma 5?min after dosing. However, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] showed remarkably prolonged blood circulation, with more than 65% of the injected dosage retained 1?h after dosing and about 26% of the injected dose detectable 24?h after dosing. The Pt remaining in systemic circulation 1?h post [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] administration was 40% in blood, suggesting that Pt does not distribute extensively in red blood cells (Figure 3a). [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated rats had a fourfold higher maximum Pt than cisplatin-treated rats (Cmax= 90.21� 3.1??g/ml versus 22.62�1.8??g/ml for [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin, respectively P<0.001 n=6; Table 1), as well as 20-fold higher plasma AUC0�24 (868.20�9.6?h�?g/ml versus 40.38�6.2?h�?g/ml, for [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin, respectively P<0.001 n=6; Table 1). The mean area under curve for total Pt in the blood is about 30% of that seen in plasma; the mean time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 0.5?h in both whole blood and plasma (Figure 3a and Table 1). Both clearance and volume of distribution (Vd) were decreased by 15-fold (0.57�0.2?ml/h versus 7.98�1.2?ml/h, for [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin, respectively P<0.001 n=6; Table 1) and 46-fold (1.8�0.2?ml/Kg versus 82.67�2.2?ml/Kg, for [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin, respectively P<0.001 n=6; Table 1), in the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] treatment group compared with the cisplatin-treatment group. The rat tissue distributions of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] are shown in Figure 3b. After a single intravenous dose of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)], kidney, liver and spleen showed the highest Pt concentration at 48?h. Statistical analyses of these data were performed using one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test, P<0.05 (compared with control). It is very interesting to note that the renal toxicity after treatment with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] is less than that of cisplatin as creatinine levels were not significantly different in the treated compared with the control group (Table 2). In addition, there was no effect on the total protein, the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase plasma levels, indicating a not obvious toxicity to the liver (Table 2). We also determined the Pt content by atomic absorption spectroscopy, in the urine and feces after [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] or cisplatin intravenous administration. Excretion of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was much lower than that of the cisplatin. The 24-h cumulative Pt excretion after [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was about eight-times less than after cisplatin treatment (4�1.6 versus 31.6�3.4%), and 8% was eliminated after 48?h. Fecal recovery represented 2.5% of the administered dose after 24?h, and 9% was excreted in the feces after 72?h. Effects of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] on kidney, liver and peripheral nervous system Light microscopic examination of the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections from day-28 killed animals, indicated a focal subcapsular tubular vacuolization, dilated subcapsular space and consistent basophilia in kidneys, and also dilated intra-lobular spaces and evident edema in liver from all animals in the cisplatin-treated group (Figure 4). Interestingly, no histopathological changes were observed in liver and kidneys from [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated group mice, compared with the controls, despite much higher platinum accumulation in these tissues relative to the compound treatment (Figure 4). In addition, punch skin biopsies were performed on the mice hind paws, and sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody to neuron-specific ubiquitin hydrolase, PGP9.5. The number of intraepidermal sensory fibers did not decrease in the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated mice group (Figure 5c). No cold hyperalgesia was present in [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated rats, based on a significantly reduced hindlimb withdrawal latency following immersion in a cold 4.5?�C water bath. In addition, thermal response to noxious heat was unaffected in hind paws of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] infused rats (Figure 5d). All baseline measures were not significantly different between groups before treatment (data not shown). Discussion We evaluated the anticancer activity in vivo of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] on the murine-tumor models to confirm the promising results previously obtained in vitro toward several human-tumor cell lines and primary breast cell.3, 4, 5, 9 Chemotherapy with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was proved to be much more effective than cisplatin. Remarkably, treatment of solid tumor-bearing mice with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)], induced up to 50% reduction of tumor mass compared with an average 10% inhibition recorded in cisplatin-treated animals. Although these in vivo experiments undoubtedly demonstrate the greater anticancer activity of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)], it might be argued that these results could have been largely predictable, as the platinum content after [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] treatment was notably higher than after cisplatin, as also previously shown in vitro.3 This difference in the platinum concentration is due to the characteristics of Pt compounds, which can bind to protein or other tissue compositions. Moreover, the effectiveness of this compound is also supported by the observation that chemotherapy with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was well tolerated. In this regard, the body weight loss of the animals was recorded daily as a sign of general toxicity. Intriguingly, mice treated with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] did not lose body weight, did not suffer from anorexia and no deterioration in health was observed, whereas those treated with cisplatin looked prostrate and showed loss of weight. Although cisplatin is one of the most effective anticancer drugs in use today, it conveys considerable toxicity to patients;10 on the other hand, very few toxicity data are available in the literature concerning anticancer agents with ?-diketonate ligand as leaving groups.11, 12 Despite the much higher accumulation of platinum in kidney, liver and spleen in the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated group (indicated by pharmacokinetics and biodistribution), there was no significant change in toxicity markers of blood chemistry, indicating no obvious toxicity to the kidney and liver. Consistent with a previous report for cisplatin,13 the greater part of Pt appears to be excreted by the kidney. Increased levels of urinary total protein and creatinine in treated animals are widely recognized as a sign of general kidney injury.14 Nevertheless, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] did not cause changes in the urinary profile compared with control rats, even at a higher dose (20?mg/kg). This is a significant result considering that renal toxicity is the most severe limitation of cisplatin treatment.15 Despite the very little information available on cisplatin-induced liver injury, hepatotoxicity is also a dose-limiting side effect in cisplatin-based chemotherapy.16, 17, 18 In fact, high doses of cisplatin can alter the clinical situation of patients.19, 20, 21 Generally, liver toxicity of cisplatin is characterized by apoptotic lesions in the liver parenchyma22 and elevation of serum transaminases. [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]-treated animals had normal serum levels of hepatic markers and no changes in tissue histopathology. In fact, histological investigations have confirmed the favorable toxicity profile of the tested [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)]. Microscopic evaluations of liver and renal tissues examined were considered similar with physiological conditions when compared with control animals. In addition, cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy can influence the quality of life and survivorship in patients. Here, mice receiving [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] did not show an alteration in the sensory fibers ascending vertically between the keratinocytes to reach the stratum corneum of the epidermis and did not develop peripheral neuropathy as resulted by the hot/cold hyperalgesia test. Most small-molecule anticancer drugs currently in clinical use, including cisplatin, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, are inherently associated with a lack of tumor selectivity and short blood circulation time, which causes various toxic side effects.23 In particular, cisplatin has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile, and all Pt-based anticancer drugs with a low molecular weight have a short half-life in the blood circulatory system.24 Nevertheless, pharmacokinetic studies with nanoparticles encapsulating Pt revealed prolonged persistence in systemic blood circulation and decreased accumulation of Pt in the kidneys, a major target site of cisplatin toxicity.25 Significantly prolonged circulation of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was observed. In addition, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] is more localized in the plasma compartment, a favorable indication for Pt being available to reach the target-tumor sites. In conclusion, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] turned out to be extremely promising in terms of greater in vivo anticancer activity, reduced nephrotoxicity and acute toxicity compared with cisplatin, thus providing a solid starting point for its validation as a suitable candidate for further pharmacological testing. Materials and Methods Reagents [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] was prepared according to previously reported procedures.1, 2 Tumor cells MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM (Celbio, Pero, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100?U/ml) and streptomycin (100?mg/ml). Cells were routinely passed by treatment with trypsin (0.05%)/EDTA. Ethics statement All animals received care in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1985), as well as in accordance with the Italian laws on animal experimentation (art. 4 and 5 of D.L. 116/92). Evaluation of maximum tolerated dose Nude BALB/c mice were randomly allocated to seven groups (five animals per group) and treated with a single intravenous injection of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] (50, 100 and 120?mg/kg), cisplatin (10, 20 and 40?mg/kg) or saline as a control. The weight and physical states of all the animals were monitored for a period of 8 days. Biodistribution and excretion study The blood persistence properties of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] and cisplatin were determined using male Wistar rats weighing ?150?g. The animals, five per group, were injected in the tail vein with [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] (10?mg/kg), cisplatin (10?mg/kg) or saline. At predetermined time intervals, blood samples were collected in pre-weighed heparinized tubes and centrifuged to get the plasma. The percentage of Pt was calculated by taking into consideration that blood constitutes 7% of the body weight and plasma constitutes 55% of the blood volume.26 Collective urine samples were accumulated over 72?h and stored frozen until directly analyzed by the flameless atomic absorption spectrometry. Tissue samples required prior digestion in concentrated nitric acid. Gentle heating was required to complete the digestion. Following evaporation to near dryness, the digests were taken up in 1?N HCl (2?ml) and again heated to near dryness to remove excess nitric acid. After repeating this last stage with 0.1?N HCl (2?ml), the digests were dissolved in 1?ml of 0.1?N HCl for Pt analysis. Platinum content in the samples was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry on a Varian SpectrAA-880Z spectrometer (Varian, Inc Vacuum Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). In vivo xenograft experiments Nude BALB/c mice (6 wk old, female, 20 to 30?g body weight) were purchased from Harlan (Carezzana, Italy) and maintained under pathogen-free conditions. The mouse MCF-7 xenograft tumor model was developed by injecting 7.5 � 106 cells of a 0.15?ml MCF-7 cell suspension into the right flank of a BALB/c mouse. Tumor cells were allowed to grow for 4 weeks without hormone support, thereafter the mice received weekly s.c. injections of 17 ?-oestradiol valerate (0.1?mg/kg body weight), in sesame oil.27 Animals were monitored daily for general health and body weights were measured twice weekly. Tumor size was measured with slide callipers and volumes were calculated as (LxW2)/2, where L and W are the major and minor diameters, respectively. Once tumor volumes reached ?100?mm3, mice were randomized to treatment and control groups of five per group. Test animals received a single intravenous of saline as a control, or two doses (5 and 10?mg/kg) of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(?-acac)(DMS)] or cispatin, the tumor volumes of BALB/c mice were measured by a vernier calliper every 3 days for 30 days in total. Histopathology The tissues of all experimental groups of animals were dissected out and immediately placed in a paraformaldehyde solution, (4%) and 20?h later it was placed in 70% ethanol until paraffin inclusion. The liver and renal tissues were included and cut into 8??m serial sections (through the medio-lateral extent) and used for histological analysis. Sections were deparaffinized and processed for staining with H&E. Punch skin biopsies from the plantar surface of the hind paws were performed and fixed in a Zamboni fixative for 24?h. Biopsies were cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4?�C. Immunohistochemistry procedures were performed as previously described, using PGP9.5 antibody.28 Behavioral measurements of induced neuropathy Cold sensitivity/hyperalgesia was assessed by immersion of the rats hindpaw into a water bath containing cold (4.5?�C) water, and latency to paw withdrawal was measured using a 1/100th second digital timer. Only one hindpaw was tested during each immersion, with the maximum cutoff time limited to 20?s. Sensitivity to noxious heat was measured using a Thermal Paw Stimulator (University of California, San Diego, CA, USA) after a 15?min acclimation period. The intensity of radiant heat was adjusted so that the vehicle-treated rats responded to the heat by elevating or licking the hindpaw approximately 10?s after the heat was initiated. A cutoff latency of 20?s was used to prevent tissue damage. The work presented was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research and University (PRIN. 2009).

Background Vitamin and mineral supplement use after a breast cancer diagnosis is common and controversial. Dosages used and the timing of initiation and/or discontinuation of supplements have not been clearly described. Methods We prospectively examined changes in use of 17 vitamin/mineral supplements in the first six months following breast cancer diagnosis among 2,596 members (28% non-white) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of initiation and discontinuation. Results Most women used vitamin/mineral supplements before (84%) and after (82%) diagnosis, with average doses far in excess of Institute of Medicine reference intakes. Over half (60.2%) reported initiating a vitamin/mineral following diagnosis, 46.3% discontinuing a vitamin/mineral, 65.6% using a vitamin/mineral continuously, and only 7.2% not using any vitamin/mineral supplement before or after diagnosis. The most commonly initiated supplements were calcium (38.2%), vitamin D (32.01%), vitamin B6 (12.3%) and magnesium (11.31%); the most commonly discontinued supplements were multivitamins (17.14%), vitamin C (15.97%) and vitamin E (45.62%). Higher education, higher intake of fruits/vegetables, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with initiation (p-values <0.05). Younger age and breast-conserving surgery were associated with discontinuation (p-values <0.05). Conclusions In this large cohort of ethnically diverse breast cancer patients, high numbers of women used vitamin/mineral supplements in the 6 months following breast cancer diagnosis, often at high doses and in combination with other supplements. The immediate period after diagnosis is a critical time for clinicians to counsel women on supplement use. Breast cancer Cohort studies Vitamins Multivitamins Dietary supplements Background American women, especially those diagnosed with cancer, commonly use dietary supplements [1,2]. Recent studies have reported that 36-87% of U.S. breast cancer survivors regularly take a form of vitamin or mineral supplement following diagnosis [3-12], with use more common among women who are older [12] or have more education [8]. Common reasons for use include the belief that it will increase tolerance to conventional treatment, alleviate treatment side effects, manage hot flashes, boost immune function, and promote general health [13]. The efficacy of supplement use for improvement of health outcomes following a breast cancer diagnosis remains unclear. The majority of studies have not found dietary supplements to improve breast cancer prognosis [5,14,15], with some showing benefit [4,6,16] and some showing harm [4]. Controversy exists regarding use of antioxidant supplements during treatment due to potential interactions with conventional therapy [17,18] and lack of clear evidence-based clinical guidelines. A recent study showed that patient and physician discussions about supplement use following a breast cancer diagnosis is uncommon [19]. Many prior studies examining the association between supplement use pre- and post-cancer diagnosis with cancer-related outcomes have had methodological limitations. These limitations included lack of detailed prospective data on supplement use, specifically around the time of diagnosis and treatment, as well as lack of data collection on changes in supplement use over time. In addition, supplement use prior to diagnosis is often not assessed and may confound associations between later supplement use and cancer outcomes [6]. We examined change in use of vitamin and mineral supplements within the first six months following breast cancer diagnosis in a prospective cohort of breast cancer survivors in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Methods Participants The Pathways Study is a prospective study of women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer who are members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated health care delivery system covering the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area, Sacramento, and surrounding counties. Recruitment was from January 2006 to April 2013 through rapid case ascertainment procedures designed to enroll women prior to initiation of chemotherapy, as described elsewhere [20]. Briefly, cases were ascertained through daily scanning of computerized pathology records for any new patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer (usually within 2 months). Participation was restricted to KPNC female members at least 21 years of age; had no previous history of malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer; spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin; and resided within a 65-mile radius of a field interviewer. The study was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board; the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Institutional Review Board; the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research; and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board. Breast cancer diagnosis and patient notification of diagnosis were verified through manual review of electronic records, and passive physician consent was obtained prior to participant recruitment. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the baseline interview. Participation rates and reasons for refusal have been described previously [20]. Potentially eligible women (n?=?11,233) were invited to participate in the study, and 4,505 enrolled (approximately 47%) after taking into account number of ineligibles, no contacts, and refusals). Primary reasons for refusal include being uninterested, too busy, too tired, other health issues, feeling overwhelmed, and/or participation in another study. Analyses presented here include 2,596 women who completed both the baseline and six-month follow-up questionnaires as of February 19, 2014, had a record in the KPNC Cancer Registry as of June December 31, 2012, and specified their race/ethnicity. The mean time from diagnosis to enrollment was 2.0 (�0.7) months, and from enrollment to follow-up 6.0 (�1.0) months. Measures Clinical and diagnostic tumor characteristics were obtained from the KPNC Cancer Registry approximately four months post-diagnosis. These included: AJCC stage at diagnosis, number of positive nodes, estrogen/progesterone receptor positivity, HER2/neu status, surgery type, and treatments received. The baseline interview was conducted at enrollment approximately two months post-diagnosis and included interviewer and self-administered questionnaires on sociodemographics, diet, physical activity, smoking, established breast cancer risk factors, health history, and use of vitamin/mineral supplements. Anthropometric measures were also obtained at baseline. Six months after the baseline interview, a packet of follow-up materials soliciting the same information collected at baseline was mailed to the participant�s home, with interviewer assistance offered if needed. Assessment of change in vitamin/mineral supplement intake At baseline and the six month follow-up, each participant was asked about multivitamins and single formulations taken at least once a week for a month or longer, with container labels being referenced if available. Women were first asked whether they had ever taken each type of supplement. For those reporting ever use of a particular supplement, consumption prior to breast cancer diagnosis was assessed for each single supplement by asking, �Did you take (vitamin/mineral) before you were diagnosed?� and for multivitamins by asking, �How many times per week did you take the multivitamin before your diagnosis?� Detailed information was then obtained regarding dose, frequency and duration of use. Multivitamin dose was assessed using the number of pills taken each time for multivitamins. Single supplement dose categories were based on common doses used in store-bought formulations. Baseline and follow-up questionnaire responses were used to establish supplement use during the two time periods of interest: 1) prior to diagnosis and 2) between baseline and the six-month follow-up interview. Use after diagnosis was defined as any yes response during the period between the baseline and six-month follow-up interviews. These data were used to identify four classifications of users for each supplement: initiators, discontinuers, continuous users, and non-users. Initiators were those using supplements after baseline but not prior to diagnosis. Discontinuers were defined as those reporting use before diagnosis but not at any time between baseline and the follow-up interview. Continuous users were those using the specified supplement both before diagnosis and at any point between baseline and follow-up. Non-users reported no use prior to or following diagnosis. Baseline assessment of diet and physical activity Diet was assessed using a 139-item modified version of the Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire (NutritionQuest, Berkeley, CA). Food items were selected by identifying the top population contributors of each nutrient among whites, African Americans, and Hispanics in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002) [21,22]. Physical activity was assessed with an activity frequency questionnaire based on the Arizona Activity Frequency Questionnaire [23]. Statistical analyses Bivariate analyses of ever use of vitamin/mineral supplements, stratified by race/ethnicity, were performed using Pearson�s chi-squared test. Next, the frequencies of never use, continuous use, initiating, and discontinuing were calculated for each supplement. To better understand patterns of use in continuous users, mean doses were established for each supplement, and changes in dose were computed by subtracting the average daily dose prior to diagnosis from the average daily dose reported at the six-month follow-up. Compared to baseline, a positive or negative value indicates an increase or decrease in dose at follow-up, respectively. Student�s t-tests were used to examine differences in dose between continuous users and initiators or discontinuers. Doses for initiators were compared with doses for continuous users at the six-month follow-up, whereas doses for discontinuers were compared with doses of continuous users prior to diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore predictors of initiation, discontinuation, and continuous use of multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E and calcium, which were the most commonly used. Models were adjusted for age, race, education, household income, family history of breast cancer, stage at diagnosis, number of positive lymph nodes, hormone receptor positivity, HER2/neu status, surgery type, treatment received, BMI, fruit/vegetable intake, physical activity and smoking status. Prior use of vitamins/minerals was not included as a covariate in the models due to the possibility of spurious associations between predictors of interest and change in supplement use. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for initiation were calculated among non-users prior to diagnosis. Similarly, among supplement users prior to diagnosis, the odds of discontinuing by the six-month follow-up questionnaire were calculated. All p-values were two-tailed with a significance level of 0.05. Results Participant characteristics Demographic and clinical characteristics for women completing both the baseline and six-month questionnaires are presented in Table 1. Study participants represent an ethnically diverse population: 71.5% non-Hispanic whites, 11.9% Asians, 10.6% Hispanics, and 6.0% African Americans. The median age at diagnosis was 61.1?�?11.8 years, and the average education level was college graduate. Most participants had either stage I (56.2%) or stage II (33.0%) breast cancer at diagnosis, and the majority had tumors positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors (64.1%).

Vitamin/mineral supplement use prior to diagnosis was highest among non-Hispanic whites (85.9%) and lowest among Hispanics (73.8%). Changes in vitamin/mineral supplement use At the six-month follow-up, 82.0% of the study population reported using at least one vitamin/mineral supplement following diagnosis with breast cancer (Table 1). Over half (60.2%) of women reported initiating a vitamin/mineral following diagnosis, 46.3% reported discontinuing a vitamin/mineral, 65.5% reported using a vitamin/mineral continuously, and only 7.2% reported not using any vitamin/mineral supplement before or after diagnosis (data not shown). Figure 1 shows the number of initiators, discontinuers, continuous users and never users for each type of vitamin/mineral supplement. Calcium (38.2%), vitamin D (32.0%), magnesium (11.3%), and vitamin B6 (10.1%) were the most commonly initiated supplements. Multivitamins (17.1%), vitamin C (16.0%), vitamin E (14.6%), calcium (9.2%), iron (9.8%), and folic acid (5.7%) were the most commonly discontinued supplements. Multivitamins (53.6%), vitamin C (16.9%), calcium (14.6%), and vitamin D (12.2%) were the most commonly used continuously from the period before diagnosis through the 6-month follow-up. Figure 1 Change in supplement use from breast cancer diagnosis to 6 months post diagnosis. For each type of dietary supplement, this figure displays the percent of participants who were never users (blue), continuous users (yellow), discontinuers (red) and initiators (green) from the time of breast cancer diagnosis to 6 months post diagnosis. Doses of vitamin/mineral supplements Doses of nearly all vitamin/mineral supplements were far in excess of the Institute of Medicine�s (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes [24] (Table 2). Among continuous users, there were notable increases in the mean consumption of vitamin D (33.8%), magnesium (18.1%) and calcium (17.0%), and substantial decreases in vitamin A (31.9%) and beta-carotene (21.1%). On average, continuous users consumed higher doses of supplements than initiators or discontinuers for most supplements, although doses were often still in excess of recommended levels.

Demographics Women over age 50 years were more likely to initiate vitamin D and calcium; continue to use calcium, vitamin E, and vitamin D; and less likely to initiate vitamin E or discontinue multivitamin supplements. Race was not strongly associated with supplement use. Higher education predicted both initiating and not discontinuing multivitamins. Higher household income was associated with not initiating multivitamins, discontinuing vitamin E, and continuously using multivitamins and vitamin D. Clinical characteristics Family history of breast cancer and several clinical characteristics, including stage, number of positive nodes, and hormone receptor status, were not associated with supplement initiation, although there was a trend against initiating multivitamins among those with higher stage tumors. There were few consistencies observed across treatment groups. Examining supplement use by treatments received, individuals undergoing chemotherapy were less likely to initiate the antioxidants vitamin C and vitamin E, continue use of vitamin D, and more likely to discontinue multivitamins. Individuals undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation were less likely to continue using multivitamins. There were differences in supplement use between women who had different surgical procedures. Among women who had a mastectomy, there was a trend toward continuing rather than discontinuing most supplements. Lifestyle factors Neither BMI nor physical activity was consistently associated with initiating or discontinuing supplement use. Women consuming higher amounts of fruits/vegetables were more likely to initiate vitamin C, vitamin D, and calcium, but not vitamin E or multivitamins. Discussion In a large prospective cohort study of women in Northern California diagnosed with first primary breast cancer, we observed high use and initiation of vitamin and mineral supplements in the six months following diagnosis. The most commonly used supplements were multivitamins, calcium, vitamin C, and vitamin D. Only a small percent of women discontinued using specific supplements during this time. On average, the doses used by women far exceeded the recommended intake levels by the IOM. In our models, women who initiated supplements were generally highly educated, consumed more fruits and vegetables, were more likely to have ever smoked cigarettes, and were less likely to have received chemotherapy; whereas women who discontinued were more likely to be under age 50, less likely to have higher education, and did not undergo a complete mastectomy. Continuous users were more likely be older, have higher education, and consume more fruits and vegetables. In general, supplement use was greater among women who consumed more fruits and vegetables, suggesting that supplement use is higher in the population that needs supplementation the least. Several prior studies have reported similarly high rates of vitamin/mineral supplementation among breast cancer patients and survivors [1,3,4,7,9-12,19,25-28]. Studies that examined use of specific supplements describe similar prevalence of multivitamin use, but much higher use of vitamins C and E than we observed [1,4,26]. Since supplement use data were collected over ten years ago for these studies, differences may represent new recommendations regarding antioxidant use during chemotherapy [29]. One study reported higher rates of overall supplement use among breast cancer survivors compared to population-based controls [1]. In general, we report that women in the study population were somewhat more likely to discontinue than initiate supplement use. Since the commonly discontinued supplements in this population were multivitamins and vitamins C and E, we hypothesize that this difference is explained by our prospective data collection among women while they are receiving treatment. Accordingly, a recent report of high-risk breast cancer patients participating in a clinical trial observed comparable changes in use during treatment, namely decreased use of multivitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E, consistent use of folate, and increases in vitamins B6 and B12 [19]. However, they did not observe similar increases in vitamin D and calcium use, likely explained by younger participant age. The findings that different measures of socioeconomic status (i.e., education and income) are associated with opposite levels of use and non-use of some of the supplements is perplexing. We think that a main take home message from these findings is that different constellations of factors are associated with use of different supplements and that it is important to consider this when interpreting dietary supplement data. The evidence-base for use of supplements during cancer treatment is inconsistent. Women are likely increasing their use of calcium and vitamin D for bone health. Prior studies suggest that calcium and vitamin D supplementation are safe for breast cancer patients [14,30]. In the Pathways Study population, African American women reported higher use of iron and vitamin B12 before diagnosis compared to other women, likely reflecting elevated anemia risk found in African Americans [31]. While a single study has shown that B12 may reduce breast cancer risk in premenopausal women [32], and other studies have shown that iron may promote carcinogenesis [33,34], enough data do not exist to reach a clear consensus to infer causation about the risks or benefits of these dietary supplements. Folic acid and B12 are necessary to regulate DNA methylation and prevent DNA damage, but supplementation during cancer treatment is controversial [35]. Chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil disrupt folate channels in order to promote tumor apoptosis, and supplementation during cancer treatment has the potential to reduce cytotoxicity [36]. Data on the effects of antioxidant use during treatment, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and carotenoids, are mixed. There is concern that antioxidants during chemotherapy and radiation therapy may reduce treatment effectiveness [29]. One hypothesis is that antioxidant supplements may effectively block the otherwise effective pro-oxidant therapies and therefore reduce treatment effects [37]. However, their effects on cancer outcomes remain unclear. Observational studies report inconsistent results on use of antioxidants and risk of recurrence and mortality in breast cancer patients [4,6]. Use of carotenoid supplements is of concern because of large human trials showing increased risk of lung cancer in those assigned to take beta-carotene [38,39]. Use of beta-carotene as an individual supplement was not common in this population, with less than two percent reporting use after diagnosis, but many women likely use multivitamins containing beta-carotene. A recent cohort study of breast cancer patients showed increased risk of mortality among those taking combination carotenoids [4] but not multivitamins [40]. Future studies utilizing information of the timing and dosage of supplement use during treatment will help clarify whether supplement interacts with or modifies the effect of conventional cancer treatments. This study presents methodological improvements over previous studies. While several prior studies were conducted within large established cohorts, this study specifically examined changes in behavior after diagnosis, distinguishing between supplement initiators and discontinuers from continuous and never users. Therefore, it was possible to examine changes in behavior, which may affect survival outcomes and be especially relevant in establishing evidence-based recommendations for patients. This study is one of the first to prospectively collect data on supplement use shortly after diagnosis, including time during treatment. This approach differs from many prior studies where patients were queried on their supplement use far after diagnosis. Several previous studies were also limited by crude measurements of supplement intake, which make it difficult to detect small associations with cancer outcomes that are likely confounded by lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. Here we report detailed information on dose, allowing for comprehensive assessment of use patterns among continuous users, initiators, and discontinuers. Strengths of this study include the large population of recently diagnosed women, an abundance of information on supplement use and relevant covariates, and prospective data collection. However, there are limitations. First, the participation rate in the Pathways study was 47% of the invited sample. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that women who enrolled in the study were healthier and more health conscious than those who did not enroll, potentially biasing our results away from the null if participants are more likely to use dietary supplements than non-participants. Differences by age and BMI at breast cancer diagnosis were minimal when comparing the enrolled to unenrolled women, respectively: average age at diagnosis 59.6 y (range: 23.6-94.8 y) vs. 61.6 y (range: 21.0-99.8 y) and 34% obese (BMI???30 kg/m2) vs. 32%. Further, the enrolled women appear largely representative of the overall breast cancer population, with a slight shift to earlier stage disease. Unenrolled women were more likely to be African American or Asian, compared to enrolled women. Second, not all women completed the 6 month follow-up questionnaire. Compared to those who completed the 6 month follow-up questionnaire, non-completers were younger, more likely to self-report as African American, Asian or Hispanic, had less education, and were diagnosed with higher stage disease. As with the non-enrollers, if the non-completers were less health conscious than the completers, study results on supplement use could be biased away from the null. In addition, this study was restricted to a single geographic region with the median education level being college graduate, which may limit generalizability of results. A strength of the study is the detailed assessment of supplement use. Trained interviewers assessed supplement use at baseline, whereas follow-up questionnaires were completed by participants. A prior study reported low validity of self-report for some supplements, compared with the gold standard of interviewer inspection of container labels [41]. However, most of the error was derived from extracting single micronutrient compositions from multivitamin supplements and distinguishing multiple vitamins and single supplements. A subsequent study reported high validity and reproducibility of self-administered mailed questionnaires, compared with in-person interview, and higher self-reported intakes were linearly correlated with increasing blood concentrations [42]. Prevalence of supplement use prior to diagnosis may be overestimated because it was assessed after diagnosis, and may not accurately represent usual intake before diagnosis. Conclusions While previous studies have shown that breast cancer patients are very likely to use vitamin and mineral supplements, we present the first large-scale study with detailed information on changes in supplement use following diagnosis in a multi-ethnic population. Current guidelines for cancer survivors recommend achieving a healthy weight; consuming a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while limiting processed foods and those high in saturated fat; "
Breast_Cancer "Metagene approaches that predict response based on gene expression signatures derived from an associative analysis of clinical data can identify chance associations caused by the heterogeneity of a tumor, leading to reproducibility issues in independent validations. In this study, to incorporate information from drug mechanisms of action, we explore the potential of microRNA regulation networks as a new feature space for identifying predictive markers. We introduce a measure we term the CoMi (Context-specific-miRNA-regulation) pattern to represent a descriptive feature of the miRNA regulation network in the transcriptome. We examine whether the modifications to the CoMi pattern on specific biological processes are a useful representation of drug action by predicting the response to neoadjuvant Paclitaxel treatment in breast cancer and show that the drug counteracts the CoMi network dysregulation induced by tumorigenesis. We then generate a quantitative testbed to investigate the ability of the CoMi pattern to distinguish FDA approved breast cancer drugs from other FDA approved drugs not related to breast cancer. We also compare the ability of the CoMi and metagene methods to predict response to neoadjuvant Paclitaxel treatment in clinical cohorts. We find the CoMi method outperforms the metagene method, achieving area under curve (AUC) values of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively. Furthermore, several of the predicted CoMi features highlight the network-based mechanism of drug resistance. Thus, our study suggests that explicitly modeling the drug action using network biology provides a promising approach for predictive marker discovery.

Introduction Discovering predictive markers in cancer treatment remains a priority as identifying patients most responsive to specific chemotherapy agents helps to maximize the benefit of treatment and to minimize unnecessary side effects. Several predictive biomarkers have been identified based on gene expression data using associative learning strategies which are primarily derived by using independent gene expression values as predictive features [1], [2], [3]. The genomic study of larger collections represents a novel approach for predictive marker discovery by identifying such markers in the preclinical setting and then validating them in a clinical trial [4], [5]. Furthermore, determining drug resistance mechanisms can aid the development of treatment strategies to overcome existing limitations in therapeutic efficacy. However, the effectiveness of such approaches can be limited by the biological heterogeneity that exists within tumors which can produce predictive gene expression signatures that are simply a consequence of chance associations, leading to impaired reproducibility in independent validations [6], [7]. There is accumulating evidence that identifying drug response pathways can help to predict treatment sensitivity [8], [9]. In such approaches, rather than performing a gene-by-gene associative analysis, distinct pathways within gene expression datasets are quantified based on mRNA values or by defining metagenes according to functional RNA interference analysis of drug response pathways [3], [6]. The Connectivity Map [10] (CMAP) was one of the first attempts to perform large-scale identification of novel drug indications and investigated gene expression changes within a preclinical setting to highlight how these signatures can reflect the complex interactions between small molecules, genes and disease. The study identified drug response profiles and searched for the negative correlations between disease expression and treatment expression signatures to construct an in silico drug screening tool. However, faced with the underlying complexity of drug induced perturbations in heterogeneous tumor tissues, we hypothesis that the development of ideal predictive markers should also incorporate information from the drug action mechanisms. MiRNAs have been identified to play a major role in a wide range of key cellular processes such as growth, development and apoptosis [11], [12], [13] and they are predicted to regulate up to one third of all protein-coding genes [14]. There is widespread evidence that microRNAs can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and their dysregulation is broadly associated with cancer initiation and progression [15], [16]. There is now multiple evidence that microRNAs are key regulators in highly connected multi-level transcriptome regulation networks (e.g. [17], [18]) as well as data highlighting the role of microRNAs in defining cancer related phenotypes such as prognosis [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] and their role as key mediators of drug actions [17], [18], [26], [27], [28]. However, compared to gene expression data, there are still limited numbers of comprehensive miRNA expression data available. Therefore, as an alternative, we consider here the microRNA regulation network an alternative feature space to interrogate drug action. We propose that investigating miRNA regulation on specific regions of the transcriptome might provide a novel perspective for relating disease state to drug treatment action. The framework of our study is shown in Fig 1 (See Methods for details). Consistent with experimental evidence, we assume that a microRNA regulates a functional gene set by targeting its target gene within the gene set and consequently impacting their expression. To this end, we introduce the concept of the Context-specific MiRNA (or CoMi) to provide a measure of the effect of miRNA regulation on a specific gene set. We achieve this by calculating the statistical difference between the distributions of target and non-target gene expression for a specific miRNA, where the gene set is determined from �specific context� data. This �specific context� can be defined from different perspectives, such as signaling pathway data, protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networks [29], [30] and Gene Ontology [31]. Thus, a set of genes with a �specific context� can be tagged with a specific biological function background, for example, sharing a common regulatory mechanism. Using this approach, we systematically evaluate the potential of the CoMi feature space for representing the drug mechanism of action and then demonstrate how the CoMi features can be used to predict patient response to Paclitaxel in three clinical trials. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g001 Figure 1 The overall framework of the present study. (a.) The CoMi method calculation process. The CoMi pattern is formed by integrating gene expression data with miRNA target and Gene Ontology information. (b.) Based on the disease differential data, we generate a CoMi disease induced network. For the drug perturbation case, we can also generate a CoMi network to represent the perturbed drug mechanism of action. In order to find the treatment for the disease, we compared the negative correlation between the cancer-induced CoMi patterns and drug treatment induced CoMi patterns. (c.) From the drug perturbation data, we build a library of drug-perturbed CoMi networks. The CoMi network can then be trained to discriminate FDA-approved breast cancer drugs from other FDA approved treatments not associated with breast cancer. (d.) Application and evaluation of the ability of the CoMi method to predict response to drug treatment from clinical data. By comparison of the drug discrimination CoMi feature with the patient response prediction CoMi patterns under similar treatment, the drug's mechanism of action can be interrogated. Results Generation of CoMi pattern networks for Methotrexate treatment in Breast Cancer We first generated the CoMi network for breast cancer in the absence of treatment (i.e. cancer vs. normal) from gene expressions sets for 43 paired patients and extracted the most significant CoMi patterns which represented the differential expressed disease signature (P-value<0.05). The network is composed of a series of edges connecting a miRNA node to a node representing a specific GO term (Fig 2) which corresponds to the CoMi pattern. Since a specific miRNA can regulate many mRNAs, which in turn are associated with other GO terms, one miRNA can have multiple edges. Conversely, a specific GO term can be affected by several miRNAs. Thus, the final CoMi pattern is a network constructed of interconnected GO terms and miRNAs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g002 Figure 2 The background newtork is the complete network generated for differential breast cancer data. And three examples of identified cancer associated CoMi sub-networks and their corresponding drug induced CoMi networks. The GO term nodes are represented by red circles and miRNA nodes by yellow diamonds. The figure also shows specific sub-networks for associated with breast cancer (left sub-network) and treatment with Methotrexate (right sub-network) for (a) �cell-cell signaling�, (b) �cell adhesion� and (c) �response to drug/metabolic process/negative regulation of cell proliferation�. The node size is proportional to the degree of the node. The value of the edge of CoMi pattern pair is the CoMi Index and the width of the edge represents the value of -log10(P value). The red edges indicate that the target genes of miRNAs associated with the indicated GO term are down-regulated. Conversely, blue edges indicate the target genes are up-regulated. In each of these three cases the regulation pattern of the breast cancer network is inversely correlated with the regulation pattern for the Methotrexate sub-network. To generate the differential disease network, we selected the CoMi patterns which had significant changes between Cancer vs. Normal, resulting in a differential disease network of 1527 edges. Investigation of the topology of the complete CoMi network reveals that both the in-degree (GO term) and the out-degree (miRNA) nodes of the network fit a power law distribution, suggesting that the network is a typical scale-free network as shown in Fig 3. Table 1 lists several highly-connected GO term nodes with a high in-degree within the network including �Signal Transduction�, �Transport�, and �Apoptosis�. The highly-connected miRNA nodes (i.e. nodes connected to many GO terms) also highlight several cancer related miRNAs, such as the previously identified onco-miRNA hsa-miR-34a, and marker miRNA hsa-miR-183-3p [32]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g003 Figure 3 The topology of the complete CoMi network analysis of the in-degree (GO term) and out-degree (miRNA) nodes of the network fit a power law distribution. The Y-axis represents the number of nodes, the X-axis is the number of In-degree/Out-degree nodes. These graphs indicate that the generated networks are typical scale-free networks. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.t001 Table 1 The most connected GO nodes and miRNA nodes in the estimated breast cancer differential CoMi network.

These miRNAs have already been found to be associated with breast cancer risk [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. For the edges around the GO term node �response to drug� the CoMi indexes are all up-regulated, whereas most of the edges around the GO term node �metabolic process� are down-regulated. Thus, the CoMi network can highlight miRNAs and biological processes associated with mechanisms of cancer progression. We then considered the perturbation pattern induced by the chemotherapy drug Methotrexate on the same CoMi sub-network based on drug induced gene expression profiles from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset [10]. The sub-networks corresponding to the cancer vs. normal networks for Fig 2a are shown in Fig 2b and show striking perturbations in their regulation patterns. In the GO term �response to drug� sub-network, all the up-regulated edges in cancer vs. normal are down-regulated by Methotrexate treatment. Similar modifications to regulation are shown in the corresponding �metabolic process� and �negative regulation of cell proliferation� sub-networks and were also found in many other sub-networks within the generated CoMi network. These network changes indicate there are several miRNAs that may play pivotal roles both in breast cancer pathology and in drug action. For example, for NBN (a breast cancer suppressor), one target gene of the key regulator hsa-miR-499-3p has also been reported to be associated with increased risk of breast cancer [38], [39], [40]. However, the global impact of hsa-miR-499-3p on the transcriptome is still unknown. In Fig 2c the CoMi network associates hsa-miR-499-3p with regulation of �response to drug� and �oxidation reduction� as well as several other predicted functions. These results suggest that the CoMi pattern network can provide insight into the global impact and mechanism of drug induced transcriptome remodeling in cancer. Identifying successful drugs using CoMi signatures We next investigated whether we could establish a more quantitative measure of the relationship between disease (breast cancer) and drug response (breast cancer treatments) using the CoMi network. Using drug response pattern entries based on gene expression data available from the CMAP database [10] we defined a discriminatory measure according to the following three steps. (1) Starting with a query profile (i.e., cancer vs. normal gene expression profiles), the cancer-specific CoMi activities pattern is represented as an �input CoMi signature�. (2) Within each query, the drug-induced CoMi network generated from the CMAP data is searched to identify drugs with signatures inversely correlated with the �input CoMi signature� based on the Spearman Coefficient. (3) A ranked list of drugs is ordered according to the Spearman Coefficient. By generating a list comprised of both standard breast cancer drugs and other randomly selected drugs associated with other treatments, we can evaluate the ability of this method to identify real drugs by considering the ranking of each candidate drug. Since several of the drugs entries in CMAP are represented by multiple instances (i.e., different concentrations and multiple cell lines), our selected dataset contains 17 drugs with different concentrations in 5 kinds of cell lines, corresponding to 103 drug instances, of which 23 were associated with FDA-approved breast cancer treatment. To investigate whether the framework could recognize these 23 breast cancer treatment instances by awarding them a high rank in the ordered drug list, a drug screening performance index (DSP index) (See Methods) and a corresponding P-value were used to estimate the reliability of the prediction. The DSP index provides a measure of the similarity of the ranked positions to the order of the original list; a positive DSP index indicates the real drugs are ranked at the top of the list. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. We then repeated the calculation using the mRNA and CMAP data to compare the discriminatory abilities of the different three methods. The CMAP method was consistent with the method used in the CMAP web-online tools [10]. Specifically, we applied the CMAP method to our testbed to assess its predictive power in identifying 17 breast cancer treatments among 6100 instances. The mRNA based method was conducted in a similar way based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and the CoMi framework but using gene expression as the feature rather than the CoMi Index. Fig 4 shows the results for the three different data types. The figure shows that the CoMi-based method provides better discrimination than the other two methods with the highest average DSP index and the narrowest 75% confidence interval. The CoMi method was performed from two different disease sources. Although the DSP index is greater than zero for the mRNA data, the majority of P-values are >0.05. Most of the values of DSP index for the CMAP method are less than zero, indicating the method failed to correctly identify the majority of true treatment drugs. The difference in the discriminative ability of these two methods is also highlighted in Table 2. Whereas the top of the ordered list generated using the CoMi-based method is enriched for breast cancer drugs, the same drugs are randomly distributed throughout the corresponding CMAP generated list. Each DSP index represents the performance of one input signature where the signature was selected according to a ranked list of CoMi index. The difference amongst signatures is based on the different window size used to generate the up and down-tags. So, when a poor result is obtained for a specific DSP index, this means the method is very sensitive to the length of the signature, which in turn is a consequence of sensitivity of the tags to the window size. Thus, the low robustness of the calculated DSP index for the original CMAP method suggests that CMAP is very sensitive to the input signature [41]. For example, for the patients in GSE15852, since each DSP index is associated with a corresponding input CoMi signature, we collected 666 CoMi patterns which were associated with the highest ranked DSP indices for the positive drugs as these CoMi patterns are the most discriminative for breast cancer treatment. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g004 Figure 4 Comparison of the drug discriminative ability of three different data sources. (a.) From left to right. Drug Screening Performance (DSP) index distribution for CoMi1&2 (GSE15852, GSE5364), mRNA expression data and CMAP. The blue box indicates the CoMi method performed with GSE15852, the line within each of the box marks the median of the values. The circles indicate outliers (defined as those laying outside approximately 99.3% coverage, the default setting in Matlab). Higher DSP values indicate stronger agreement with an ordered drug list that places breast cancer treatments at the top. (b.) Corresponding estimated P-values for the three method plotted as ?log10 (P-value). The horizontal blue line indicates the ?log10 (0.05) threshold which is considered significant. Both of the CoMi results have all values greater than zero. Although the mRNA data has majority of points greater than zero, the majority of P-values are >0.05. DSP values for CMAP are almost equally distributed between positive and negative values and consequently, none of the associated P values are <0.05. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.t002 Table 2 Ranked drug list for CoMi based and CMAP based methods.

Therefore, we next considered the ability of the CoMi method to predict response to drug treatment in a drug treatment regime in breast cancer patients. We selected a dataset from a breast cancer cohort study [42] and identified potential predictive biomarkers for response to treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. "
Breast_Cancer "All the patients in these cohorts were treated with the T-FAC regime which is one of the most common neoadjuvant chemotherapies for breast cancer. The TFAC regime consists of Paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A), and cyclophosphamide(C). To investigate the CoMi index's predictive ability for the outcome of the drug treatment process, we generated the CoMi index and their associated P-values based on the microarray data provided by three separated neo-adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials. We split the data into training and testing components and then applied various machine learning methods. (See Methods for details). We searched for the most significant CoMi patterns features where activity among the patients was highly discriminative in terms of pathological complete response (pCR) by using the t test to calculate the statistical difference of the CoMi index between the two groups in the training set. We then used a classifier to train the features in the training set, and tested them in the testing set. In the training stage we used under-sampling since the dataset was imbalanced (pCR/no pCR?=?26/152). This process of training and testing was iterated repeatedly as shown in Fig 1d. In this way we identified 27 CoMi elements as potential biomarkers which were distinct in patients with and without a pCR. We next tested the predictive performance of CoMi markers during classification of pCR and non-pCR. The CoMi index was used as input features for three classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM and logistic regression). The classification was performed using five-fold cross-validation within each data set and repeated 100 times. The CoMi method achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 in dataset GSE20271. For comparison, we also tested the performance of the Paclitaxel based metagenes identified in the study by Juul et al [6], and achieved a corresponding AUC of 0.66. The CoMi method also achieved an AUC of 0.76 and 0.77 using a Na�ve Bayes classifier and SVM classifier respectively compared to AUCs of 0.60 and 0.56 from the Paclitaxel metagene response as shown in the Table 3. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.t003 Table 3 AUC scores for three different classifiers with different types of markers for Metagene and CoMi datasets. Logistic model Na�ve Bayes classifier SVM Metagene(12) 0.6647 0.6000 0.5564 CoMi(27) 0.7870 0.7560 0.7732 We further independently tested the potential markers in other two cohorts MDA1 and MDA/MAQC-II [2], [43], [44]. The features tested both CoMi patterns and Paclitaxel metagenes for comparison. For independent validation, we used the features identified from GSE20271 to test MDA1+ MDA/MAQC-II, and achieved an AUC of 0.78 using a logistic regression model. As shown in Fig 5a-c, the ROC of three different classifier results also highlights the improved accuracy of the CoMi method over the metagene method [6]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g005 Figure 5 the CoMi pattern markers for pCR prediction for three different classifiers. (a) ROC using Logistic Regression (b) ROC using Naive Bayes classifier (c) ROC using SVM classifier (d) the clustergram of the identified 27 CoMi predictors (Y axis) for the outcomes of the patients response (X axis) in clinical trials MDA1+ MDA/MAQC-II. The line under the graph shows the label of the class (0 for the pCR group, 1 for the no pCR group). Most of the patients that have pCR are clustered in the right hand clade (X axis) which suggests that the markers can effectively cluster the pCR patients. For the 27 identified CoMi features, we next investigated the correlation between the CoMi pattern across samples and the outcome of pCR status. Several CoMi markers showed a significant positive correlation with the group of patients with pCR, and a significantly negative correlation with the group of patients without pCR (Fig 6a). The CoMi pattern of potential markers in this figure also reveals several interesting regulatory relationships indicating miRNA regulation on GO Terms. Some of these GO Terms are closely related to drug effect, such as �immune response�, �signal transduction� and �G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling�. In particular, Fig 6a shows that hsa-miR-182-3p has a strong regulatory effect on several GOBP Terms including �endoplasmic reticulum� and �endoplasmic reticulum membrane�. This is consistent with a previous report that hsa-miR-182-3p is over-expressed in breast cancer [45]. Furthermore, ESR1 also has an association with another important onco-miRNA, hsa-miR-18a [46]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g006 Figure 6 The CoMi pattern used to predict pCR in clinical trials involving Paclitaxel.

The edges represent activities pattern where green lines indicate highly negative correlations, red lines indicate positive correlations.

The distribution of the CoMi index (hsa-miR-18a on �Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent�) in two the groups of patients. (d.) The fold change of the average expression from the patients without pCR to the group of people has pCR of the gene ESR1 and the CoMi pattern. The blue bar represents the average value of CoMi Index of patients without pCR, while the red bar is the average value of the group of patients with pCR. (e.) The regulation network of two CoMi activities with its target gene. Gene ESR1 is the target of the CoMi pattern of hsa-miR-18a's regulation on the GO term �Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent�, it is also the target of the CoMi pattern of hsa-miR-33a's regulation on the GO term �Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent�. Predictive CoMi features provide a network view of drug response A recent paper investigated the mitotic and ceramide pathway as a predictor of response to chemotherapy with neoadjuvant Paclitaxel and 12 metagenes were ultimately shown to be significantly associated with response in pCR patients who have a pathological complete response (referred to as Paclitaxel metagenes hereafter) [6]. In this study we investigated the connection between the target genes revealed by our CoMi markers and the Paclitaxel metagenes. We selected the Paclitaxel metagene ESR1 (which is a target gene associated with the GO term �regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent� and the hsa-miR-18a target geneset) as an example and compared the expression of ESR1 in a group of pCR and no pCR patients respectively. As shown in Fig 6b, ESR1 is down-regulated in the pCR response compared with the no pCR response. The CoMi pattern of hsa-miR-18a regulation on the GO term �regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent� is up-regulated in the pCR response compared with the no pCR response (Fig 6c), indicating that hsa-miR-18a might target and down-regulate the expression of genes (such as ESR1) involved in the GO term �regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent�. Comparison of the statistical significance of the respective t test results for the pCR and no pCR groups suggests that the CoMi index is changed more significantly than the target gene ESR1. Since the CoMi index data cannot be directly compared to the gene expression data, we compared the rate of change for ESR1 and the CoMi pattern for �regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent�/hsa-miR-18a for the pCR group to the no pCR group using the fold change of the average expression. The results are shown in Fig 6d. The left-hand bars show the changes for ESR1, and the right paired bars show the changes for the CoMi pattern. The CoMi pattern not only achieves better discriminatory performance than the gene expression of the metagenes, but the pattern also provides important information on biological processes that are involved in the drug response. This is summarized in Fig 6e which shows that the GO term �regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent� is also regulated by another miRNA �hsa-miR-33b� suggesting it may be a key biological process in tumorigenesis. Predictive CoMi features are in line with published metagene Since the metagenes were selected from the Paclitaxel resistant pathway experimental study by Juul N, et al [6], their predicted CoMi features can be used to reveal their associated biological mechanisms. These are summarized in Fig 7 and Table 4. For example, from Table 4, we observe that the CoMi pattern of the effect of hsa-miR-548b-3p on the GO Term: �Oxidation reduction� has three Paclitaxel metagenes (PGR, COL4A3BP and GBA3) Paclitaxel. Interestingly, the expression of these genes didn't show significant differences between the pCR and no pCR groups (data not shown), which suggests that the CoMi feature might integrate the collective effects of marginal changes of multiple genes involved in the same GO term. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g007 Figure 7 The relationship between the predictive CoMi pattern and the published metagene. The left box lists the miRNAs in the CoMi pattern that was identified as a predictive marker. The right box lists the 12 metagenes identified in the study by Juul N, et al [6] on the Paclitaxel resistant pathway. We predicted that some elements of the CoMi pattern (e.g. hsa-miR-548b-3p on the GO Term: �Oxidation reduction�) have a repressive effect on some of the metagenes (e.g. GBA3, COL4A3BP and PGR) as shown by the three arrows from the miRNA to its target genes. 10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.t004 Table 4 List of overlapped CoMi patterns in drug-discriminating CoMi features and patients-classification CoMi features. miRNA GO Term hsa-miR-302c extracellular region hsa-miR-574-5p extracellular region hsa-miR-17 mitochondrial inner membrane hsa-miR-599 Golgi apparatus hsa-miR-892b plasma membrane hsa-miR-509-3-5p integral to membrane hsa-miR-18a regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent hsa-miR-323-5p Proteolysis hsa-miR-22 protein transport Predictive CoMi features are related to drug mechanism of action Table 4 lists the several associations between the CoMi features for Paclitaxel response and the CoMi features for breast cancer treatment discrimination. Since the patients were treated with neoadjuvant drugs, and two of these drugs, Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin, were both tested individually for their treatment effect, we next considered whether their CoMi features could show an association based on the breast cancer treatment effect. To this end, we checked the consistency of informative CoMi features in discriminating successful drugs (�drug-classification CoMi�) with the predictive CoMi features for drug response in patients (�patients-classification CoMi�). For the 666 drug-classification CoMi identified in section 2.2 and the 27 identified CoMi for patients' outcome there are 9 overlaps (Table 4). The significant overlap (Hyper-geometric test P-value ?=?7.9226e?09) indicates that these two CoMi list are significantly consistent, suggesting these CoMis are useful not only as predictors for drug response, but also as an optimized representation of Paclitaxel action on patients. Discussion In this present study we introduce the concept of the CoMi (Context-specific-MiRNA-regulation) as a representation of the miRNA regulation network in the transcriptome. One of the basic assumptions is that a miRNA is involved in a biological process through regulation of its target genes, and that a subset of genes within the same biological process are not necessarily regulated by the same miRNA. This is supported by multiple studies [12], [47], [48], [49], [50]. In this work we use the Gene Ontology (GO) to abstract a miRNA's regulation on to a specific GO biological process. In this way we can interpret the significance of an identified relationship such as cancer, normal or drug treatment. There have been many studies that have focused on the difference between miRNA target and non-target gene expression to estimate the activity of the miRNA [51]. Here, based on the specific context definitions, a single miRNA and a particular biologically meaningful gene set, we divide the gene set into two parts consisting of the miRNA target and non-target genes. The expression differences between the two subsets are then considered to be representative of a miRNA's regulatory contribution. In this way, we define the CoMi as an abstract probe to profile the regulation intensity for each miRNA within each biologically annotated gene set. In the present study we demonstrated the use of the CoMi as a new way to interpret the hidden biological process in the mechanism of action of drugs on the transcriptome network, and to quantitatively discriminate successful breast cancer drugs from their peers by combining miRNA target information with Gene Ontology biological annotation modules. There are already several published works that explore the miRNA's functional association through biological functional modules. Some of these approaches integrate the miRNA's target information with functional gene modules to filter the potential mRNA target and consider the potential function of miRNA [52], [53]. Another approach uses the miRNA's target information enriched in similar Gene Ontology terms to build a synergistic miRNA-miRNA network [54]. These authors have also used drug perturbation data to construct a miRNA-miRNA network in an attempt to interfere possible roles in cancer in order to identify drug candidates [55]. In our work, we are able to abstract the miRNA's regulation on a specific GO biologic process, and describe its significance and repression level. We use the CoMi as a novel perspective for analyzing breast cancer differential data and use this to build a CoMi network. Furthermore, we link the disease and drug by using the strong negative correlation of a miRNA's regulation in different conditions to discover the CoMi network of drug related function and the drug mechanism of action. This is the first report that uses such a network to analysis the drug mechanism of action and predicts drug sensitivity. Following the pioneering work of the Connectivity Map, there have been several subsequent efforts that attempt to use gene expression signatures or modules to identify potential drug treatments [10], [41], [56]. However, these analyses are very sensitive to the input signature [41]. By incorporating gene expression data and the miRNA regulations that describe the underlying biological network, we demonstrate that our CoMi network based approach offers greater sensitivity compared to methods based only on gene expression data. In recent years, an increasing number of disease markers have been identified through analysis of genome-wide expression profiles [42]. However, these marker sets appear to share very little in common and lack functional network insight information. This highlights one the primary limitations of using predictive gene expression signatures based on small and unbalanced samples; this leads to impaired reproducibility in independent validations [6], [7]. By integrating gene expression profiles from clinical trials with our CoMi method, the data is mapped into a CoMi pattern. We can then identify several CoMi activities with significant P-values as potential biomarkers for the response to the therapy. Our results show that CoMi features outperform published gene expression patterns or �metagenes� selected from functional RNA interference analysis of drug response pathways [6] and demonstrate that the CoMi biomarkers can also be related to the gene target in the drug response pathway. Results on the benchmark datasets indicate this approach is effective and outperforms the gene expression method, and can reveal additional informative features related to drug response mechanisms. Nevertheless, despite these advantages, there is still room for improvement. The current limitations in accuracy and specificity of miRNA target prediction adds noise to the network, and redundancy and inaccuracies in the Gene Ontology causes further imprecision in the predicted network patterns. As these are refined through experiment and curation, this will improve further the prediction efficiency and inaccuracy. Materials and Methods Workflow The study is organized into four parts (Fig 1): (1) Using the gene expression as input and the Gene Ontology as context, we integrate miRNA target information with associated GO terms to calculate the CoMi profile. (2) Using breast cancer as an example, we combine the disease and drug perturbation gene expression patterns with the CoMi activities and map the data into a CoMi pattern. This CoMi pattern can then be used to build a disease-specific CoMi network and a drug differential CoMi network. (3) We then establish a drug discrimination method to verify the CoMi's performance by promoting FDA approved breast cancer drugs within the library to extract the most discriminative CoMi features related to breast cancer. (4) Finally, we convert the clinical data of breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant Paclitaxel into a CoMi pattern, then predict response to neoadjuvant Paclitaxel using CoMi features, demonstrating the CoMi features reveal more informative biological meanings compared to the mRNA based method. Datasets used in the study and generation of target and non-target gene sets The Breast cancer disease datasets were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GEO GSE15852, GSE5364) and contained expression data from 43 and 13 human breast tumors and their paired (adjacent) normal tissues respectively. Each gene in the expression dataset was mapped to a subset of Gene Ontology terms (i.e., Gene Ontology Biological Process-GOBP and Gene Ontology cellular component-GOCC) to define a �context-specific� gene set. The age range was from 22 to 79. The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) and GCOS version 2.0 using the default Affymetrix analysis settings. The clinical diagnosis was limited to a few terms: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma and ductal carcinoma. MiRNAs target gene information was generated for each miRNA by collecting target predictions from the online miRNA target prediction sources, (ExprTargetDB [57] which combines miRanda [58], TargetScan [59] and PicTar [60]) and consolidating as described in detail in our earlier report [32]. Generation of the CoMi Network and CoMi patterns The CoMi network was generated based on the premise that a given miRNA, miRNAi, targets several genes represented by a gene set Mi. Similarly, a given GO term GOj (taken from the Gene Ontology Biological Process-GOBP and Gene Ontology cellular component-GOCC vocabulary) will be mapped to several genes, forming a �context specific� gene set Gj for that GO term. The intersection of these two sets Mi?Gj can be considered to represent the regulation of GOj by miRNAi and partitions Gi into two subsets of target and non-target genes. By applying the hyper-geometric test to these target and non-target genes we can identify significant overlap for any Mi?Gj and in these cases generate a corresponding CoMi pattern CoMiij. Taken together, the set of all CoMiij pairs represent a CoMi profile and, because of the overlap between different CoMiij, form an overall CoMi network for the miRNA/GO dataset (Fig 8)."
Breast_Cancer "10.1371/journal.pone.0098140.g008 Figure 8 Schematic of generation of CoMi profile for a specific miRNA/GO Term pair. The yellow diamond represents a miRNA, the trapezoid represents a gene. Some of the genes could be repressed by its targeting miRNA as shown by a arrow from the miRNA to the gene. The green and red colours correspond to up- and down-regulation respectively and the height of the gene trapezoid correponds to expression level. The pink ellipse encompassing the set of genes represents a GO term. An arrow from an miRNA to a target gene within a GO term indicates this miRNA has a significant effect on this GO term as determined by the hypergeometric test and this miRNA/GO term pair is referred as a CoMi pattern. By searching each GO term for significant miRNA pairing we generate a CoMi profile and and an associated CoMi index which represents how much influence a specific miRNA influences the GO term (calculated from the statistical difference between the miRNA's target and non target genes expression within the GO term). By considering different perturbations (e.g. cancer or drug effects), we can build a CoMi network based on these CoMi patterns and by extracting the most significant CoMi patterns according to the estimated P-value of the CoMi index, we can generate breast cancer signature based on CoMi patterns and generate a CoMi network. A given CoMi pattern CoMiij does not change, i.e., the target and non-target gene sets are fixed. What can change for a disease or drug treatment is the expression levels of the genes in the target and non-target sets. We quantify these expression levels by defining a CoMi index for each condition (i.e. normal vs. disease vs. drug treatment). This CoMi network can then be used to represent (i) gene expression data from drug treatment in CMAP (DRGEXP), and (ii) disease expression data from GEO (DISEXP) by calculating a CoMi index for each CoMi pattern identified in the previous step for DRGEXP and DISEXP respectively. Significant changes between target and non-target genes for a given CoMiij were identified by using the t-test (described below) and are assumed to correspond to the effect of the up or down regulation by miRNAi on GO term GOj. The respective CoMi profiles for DRGEXP and DISEXP can then be compared to identify significantly inversely correlated profiles. For example, if the disease state produces a significant down regulation of a group of genes by miRNAi, then the drug treatment affects a corresponding up-regulation of the same gene set. In this way, disease relevant CoMi networks can be identified. Generation of networks Networks were generated using Matlab and Cytoscape was used for visualization [61]. Network topology was investigated using the Network Analysis plug-in for Cytoscape. Because miRNA are mediators, i.e., they have the ability to silence a gene, the miRNAs were considered outgoing edges and GO terms incoming edges, and the in-degree and out-degree of each node was determined. Identification of CoMi patterns significantly associated with disease and with drug treatment To identify significant changes in target gene expression values brought about by the presence of a particular disease we compared the changes in expression values for target and non-target genes for a specific miRNA for normal and disease states. For each CoMi pattern CoMiij we performed the t-test as follows:where stands for the fold change vector (cancer vs. normal) of the miRNA target gene set, is the fold change vector (cancer vs. normal) of the non-target gene set, nT is the number of miRNAs target genes and nNT is the number of non target genes. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Similarly, we identified drug induced CoMi change as follows:where stands for the fold change vector (drug treatment vs. normal) of the miRNA target gene set, is the fold change vector (drug treatment vs. normal) of the non-target gene set, nT is the number of miRNAs target genes and nNT is the number of non target genes. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. The drug-induced gene expression change of known drugs was derived from the CMAP dataset, consisting of expression profiles from five different human cell lines treated with 1309 different compounds at different concentrations [10]. Generation of the drug reference library To build a reference library of drugs as a test dataset to investigate the ability of the CoMi method to distinguish drugs associated with disease treatment from other drugs, we selected gene expression information from the Connectivity Map [10] for a set of selected drugs and mapped them into a CoMi pattern as described above. 17 drugs were selected based on their overlap between the �standard agent database� [62] and CMAP with 103 instances in CMAP (corresponding to multiple dose treatment for one drug). 5 of these 17 were recognized breast cancer drugs in routine clinical usage (23 instances in CMAP) with successful outcome. Identification of CoMi patterns associated with drug treatment To identify CoMi patterns that were associated with drug treatment we generated a disease query signature by combining the top k up-regulated CoMi activities (the up-tag), and the bottom k down-regulated CoMi activities (the down-tag) from the cancer specific CoMi patterns, where k?=?5 to k?=?1/3 of the number of CoMi patterns in the profile. In the same way, a query signature was calculated from each entry in the drug CoMi pattern library. Finally, the Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated between the disease query signature and each instance of the drug query and the drugs were ranked based on this value. To determine whether this method could distinguish recognized drug treatments for breast cancer from other randomly selected drugs, all the n instances in the candidate instance library were ranked in an ascending order according to the Spearman correlation coefficient, resulting in a drug ranked list. We then used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic to test whether the rank positions of the 23 successful breast cancer drug instances from CMAP were significantly enriched at the top of the ranked list. Where t the number of positive drugs in the library (23), j denotes the jth drug instance according to the rank within the N drugs in the list, and V(j) is the ranked position of the jth drug instance. To estimate the corresponding DSP P-value, the data was bootstrapped by permuting the rank position of successful-drug-related instances and counting how many times the absolute value of the random KS score was larger than the absolute value of the real KS score for 1000 times. We denoted this P-value as the �Drug Screening Performance P-value� (DSP P-value). To compare the predictive abilities of the CoMi method with alternative features we also calculated the DSP based using gene expression values based on mRNA as well as the original CMAP method, but using the Spearman coefficient rather than the KS statistic. Patient CoMi pattern calculation We retrieved the gene expression and treatment response data from three cohorts from three neo-adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials. The datasets (GSE20271, MDA and MDA/MAQC-II) [2], [43], [44] with associated Affymetrix microarray analyses were derived from the primary tumor prior to drug treatment (Paclitaxel). Since the MDA1 and MDA/MAQC-II trials were done by the same investigators, at the same site, with the identical gene expression platforms, we combined the two T-FAC treated cohorts to increase statistical power for univariate logistic regression analysis as performed in the original study [63]. For the 178 patients of GSE20271 and 233 patients from MDA1 and MDA/MAQC-II, the pCR (pathological complete response) status was determined at the time of surgery. In all cases, response to therapy defined in terms of pathologic complete response (pCR) was determined at the time of surgery. We converted the gene expression pattern of each patient into a CoMi pattern as follows:where stands for the average gene expression value of the miRNA target genes, is the gene expression values of the non-target gene set, nT is the number of miRNAs target genes and nNT is the number of non target genes. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant Patient response prediction To investigate the ability of the CoMi index to act as a predictor of the outcome of drug treatment process, we generated CoMi Index and their associated p-values for the datasets from the three neo-adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials above and applied various machine learning methods. The CoMi index associated P-values and clinical outcome pCR/nopCR were used as inputs. We divided the data into training data (80%) and testing data (20%) and classification was performed with five-fold cross-validation. Potential biomarker features were selected from the training set and then applied to the test set. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for the test data was used to evaluate classification performance. The AUC value was the average value of 1000 classification results and we searched for the optimum number of CoMi features that produced the best accuracy. Three classifiers, multiple logistic regression analyses, and SVM and Naive Bayes were tested using the Matlab toolbox version 2010b. Comparison with identified Paclitaxel resistant metagenes Here we compared the prediction performance of CoMi features with the metagenes based on the reported data from the work of Juul N, et al, which investigated the mitotic and ceramide pathway as a predictor of the response to chemotherapy using the neoadjuvant Paclitaxel. Twelve metagenes were identified as being significantly associated with response in pCR patients [6]. In the prediction process, the training data was generated by under-sampling to obtain a balanced dataset and the 12 metagenes were used as features to train for the Metagene dataset and then tested in the testing set repeatedly to generate an average AUC value as the same process with CoMi features. For the CoMi features that were investigated for Paclitaxel resistant, correlation between the 27 CoMi feature's Index expressions with the outcome of the pCR status is shown in Fig 6a. The Person correlation coefficient is used to estimate the relationship of the 27 CoMi and the outcome of the pCR status.

Breast_Cancer "A recent report provides a detailed side-by-side presentation of CEE?+?MPA and CEE effects on breast cancer and other outcomes during the intervention and post-intervention phases of the WHI trials [11]. Serum sex hormone concentrations changed markedly following CEE or CEE?+?MPA administration in the WHI trial cohorts, with an approximate doubling of estradiol, estrone sulphate and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and an approximate tripling of estrone with active treatment in each trial [12]. A recent report on a breast cancer nested case-control study within the CEE?+?MPA trial cohort noted that the treatment odds ratio was appreciably larger for women having relatively low baseline serum estrogens. For example, the OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) for breast cancer with CEE?+?MPA treatment was 2.47 (1.28, 4.79) among women in the lowest estradiol quartile, compared to 0.96 (0.44, 2.04) in the highest quartile [13]. Here we follow-up on this intriguing observation by examining the association between baseline serum sex hormones in the CEE?+?MPA and CEE trials and breast cancer risk, separately in the active treatment and placebo groups, during the intervention phases of the WHI trials. Concurrent associations of sex hormone changes from baseline to one year following randomization are also considered, and mediation analyses are conducted to examine the extent to which sex hormone changes can provide an explanation for the breast cancer findings in the two WHI trials. Methods Study population: breast cancer cases and controls The design of the WHI Clinical Trial (CT) and corresponding baseline enrollee characteristics have been presented [14,15]. All women were postmenopausal and in the age range 50 to 79 when enrolled at 40 U.S. clinical centers during 1993 to 1998. The CT enrolled 68,132 women to either or both of a hormone therapy trial (27,347 women) or a low-fat dietary pattern trial (48,835 women). The CEE?+?MPA trial randomly assigned 16,608 women with uterus to 0.625 mg/d oral CEE plus continuous 2.5 mg/d MPA, or matching placebo. The CEE trial randomly assigned 10,739 women who were post-hysterectomy to this same oral estrogen preparation or placebo. Women were excluded from the HT trials for breast cancer or other prior cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) within the past 10 years, baseline mammogram or clinical breast exam suggestive of cancer, or predicted survival of less than three years. Women having ongoing or recent HT use at screening required a three-month washout period before becoming eligible. The CEE?+?MPA trial intervention phase stopped early in July 2002, following an average of 5.6 years of intervention, when it was judged that health risks exceeded benefits. An elevation in breast cancer risk, in conjunction with an unfavorable global health risk versus benefit index, was key to the early stopping decision [1]. The CEE trial also stopped early in February 2004, primarily because of a stroke elevation of similar magnitude to that for CEE?+?MPA, following an average 7.1 years of intervention [5]. Clinical outcomes [16] were reported semi-annually in the CT through the end of the intervention period by self-administered questionnaires. Invasive breast cancer occurrences were confirmed by review of medical records and pathology reports by physician-adjudicators at local clinical centers. These events were classified centrally using NCI�s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results coding system, including coding of histology, hormone receptor status and HER2 over-expression. All women provided written informed consent for their various components of WHI participation, and for their participation in the postmenopausal hormone therapy randomized controlled trials. The protocol and informed consent documents and procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and by the IRBs of each of the participating clinical centers. All research was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. There were 348 and 235 (invasive) breast cancer cases having sufficient serum for sex hormone analyses during the intervention phases of the CEE?+?MPA and CEE trials, respectively. Each was matched to a control from the same trial cohort who was without breast cancer during the trial intervention phase, on age at screening (within one year), race (white, black, Hispanic, other) and date of randomization (within 30 days). Blood samples and measurements of endogenous sex hormones Blood samples were collected at baseline and year 1 after an overnight fast of at least 12 hours [17]. Specimens were separated and stored at -70�C within two hours of collection prior to shipping to a central repository. Baseline and one-year serum specimens from a case and matched control were batched together, and sent to the Reproductive Endocrine Research Laboratory (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA) for sex hormone assessment. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case versus control status, and to baseline versus one-year collections. Total estradiol and estrone concentrations were quantified by radioimmunoassays (RIA) using methods previously\described [13]. Estrone sulfate was measured by direct RIA using a commercial kit (Beckman Coulter, Minneapolis, MN, USA). SHBG was quantified by use of a direct chemiluminescent immunoassay using the Immulite Analyzer (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Malvern, PA, USA). Bioavailable (non-SHBG-bound) estradiol concentration was calculated by an algorithm that uses the total estradiol and SHBG measurements [13]. Split sample quality control specimens, derived from women who were screened for WHI participation but did not enroll, were included in each assay batch. There were 60 such samples selected for the baseline hormone assays, and 60 for the year 1 assays in this case-control study. The quality control specimens revealed substantial variations between blind duplicate samples for a small fraction of pairs, particularly at low concentrations. However, the intra-assay coefficients of variation for the various assays were acceptable, and ranged from 4.2% to 13.4%, after excluding outliers that had differences between duplicates following log-transformation that exceeded twice the interquartile range (IQR). The assay sensitivities for estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate and SHBG were 2, 4 and 50 pg/ml, and 1 Nmol/L, respectively.Study subjects were excluded from analyses for each analyte if one or both of the baseline and year 1 assessments did not yield a measurement. The number of individuals excluded in the CEE?+?MPA trial was 49 for estradiol, 61 for bioavailable estradiol, 49 for estrone, 105 for estrone sulfate and 46 for SHBG. The corresponding numbers for the CEE trial were 35, 43, 33, 85 and 36. Statistical methods Serum hormone measurements were log-transformed to achieve approximate normal distributions. In response to the split sample blind duplicate data mentioned above, cases or controls were excluded for a specific analyte if the logarithm of the ratio of one-year to baseline values was outside of the 25th to 75th percentiles of the data by more than twice the IQR, separately by trial and randomization group. OR modeling relied on logistic regression with case (1) or control (0) defining the binary �response� variable [18]. Odds ratios were estimated as a function of (log-transformed) baseline and year 1 concentrations. For ease of interpretation, ORs corresponding to a doubling of the serum hormone concentrations are presented. Mediation was assessed by comparing the post-year 1 breast cancer OR associated with hormone therapy when only baseline serum hormones were included in the model, to the corresponding hormone therapy OR when year 1 serum hormone concentrations, or equivalently the ratio of year 1 to baseline concentrations, were added to the OR model. Mediation is indicated by hormone therapy ORs that move substantially toward the null when the year 1 analyte data are included. In addition to the matching factors of age and race, the logistic regression analyses included baseline body mass index (BMI), family history of breast cancer, cigarette smoking history and Gail model five-year breast cancer risk score [19] as control variables. Nominal 95% CIs are presented for odds ratios, and all significance levels (P-values) are two-sided. Results Table  1 presents distributional information for breast cancer cases and controls, separately for the CEE and CEE?+?MPA trials, in relation to several baseline characteristics. The average age for cases was about 64 years, and average BMI was about 30.

Subsequent analyses exclude 31 breast cancer cases in the CEE?+?MPA trial and 16 cases in the CEE trial that occurred during the first year from randomization. The log-transformed ratios of year 1 to baseline values had approximately normal distributions for each sex hormone, but with a small fraction of outlying values, as anticipated from the blind duplicate data. Applying the interquartile range criterion (see Methods) led to the further exclusion of the following number of placebo cases or controls in the CEE?+?MPA trial: estradiol - 20, bioavailable estradiol - 25, estrone - 25, estrone sulfate - 28, SHBG - 21. Corresponding numbers in the active treatment group in the CEE?+?MPA trial were 11, 19, 11, 7 and 10; with the smaller number of exclusions consistent with the notion that measurement reliability is primarily an issue at low concentrations. The corresponding numbers of cases or controls excluded from the CEE trial placebo group on the basis of this IQR criterion were 31, 30, 17, 16 and 31, and from the CEE trial active treatment group were 9, 10, 5, 10 and 3. Tables  2 and 3 show geometric means and 95% confidence intervals for cases and controls for each analyte, separately for the placebo and active groups in the CEE?+?MPA trial and the CEE trial. In the placebo group in either trial one sees the expected positive association between baseline or year 1 serum estrogens, and the inverse association of baseline SHBG, with disease risk. These same patterns prevail in the active treatment group in the CEE trial. In contrast, these patterns are not at all evident in the active treatment group in the CEE?+?MPA trial, suggesting that the use of CEE?+?MPA overrides the expected associations of baseline sex hormone concentrations with breast cancer risk.

Odds ratios for a two-fold increment in baseline sex hormone level are presented from logistic regression analyses that control for various breast cancer risk factors (see Methods), in separate analyses for each analyte. Positive associations with most baseline estrogens and an inverse association with SHBG are evident in the placebo groups and in the active treatment group in the CEE trial. However, these associations are not evident in the active treatment group in the CEE?+?MPA trial.

Table  5 examines the ability of sex hormone changes from baseline to year 1 following randomization to mediate the divergent effects of the two hormone therapy regimens on breast cancer incidence. Odds ratios for a two-fold increment in baseline sex hormones are presented, along with odds ratios for a two-fold increment (�change�) from baseline to year 1. The upper part of Table  5 includes bioavailable estradiol and SHBG jointly, while the lower part includes the other four serum estrogen measures simultaneously along with SHBG (bioavailable estradiol is calculated from the other measures and can not be included with them). The two parts of the Table provide a similar message: inclusion of the baseline to year 1 sex hormone changes in the regression model has little impact on the treatment odds ratio for CEE?+?MPA, but doing so appreciably increases the treatment OR for CEE toward the null. For example, in the lower part of Table  5, inclusion of the baseline to year 1 change variables in the analysis moves the estimated CEE?+?MPA treatment OR slightly away from the null, from 1.59 to 1.65, whereas the estimated CEE treatment OR moves substantially toward the null, from 0.71 to 0.92. While the upper part of Table  5 suggests that the SHBG increase with CEE may compensate somewhat for corresponding serum estrogen increases, the more detailed analysis in the lower part of Table  5 suggests that women having relatively large increases in serum estrone with CEE are at reduced breast cancer risk.

Hormone therapy mediation is indicated by treatment odds ratios that move substantially toward the null when the year 1 sex hormone data are included. Discussion These analyses provide insight into the divergent breast cancer findings with CEE?+?MPA versus CEE in the WHI randomized, controlled trials. Specifically, women at a relatively low baseline breast cancer risk in the CEE trial continue at low risk if assigned to active treatment. Furthermore, the configuration of sex hormone changes among women assigned to active CEE provides an explanation for much of the observed breast cancer risk reduction (Table  5). In sharp contrast, there is no evidence for any association between baseline sex hormone levels and breast cancer risk among women assigned to active treatment in the CEE?+?MPA trial, whereas associations are apparent in the placebo group (Table  4). Moreover, breast cancer risk does not relate to changes in sex hormones from baseline to year 1 in the CEE?+?MPA trial (Table  5). Evidently, in the presence of 2.5 mg/d medroxyprogesterone acetate, these risk variations are quite unimportant. Women having a favorable serum sex hormone profile, perhaps from years of good diet and activity patterns and normal weight maintenance, evidently have similar elevated breast cancer risk to those having an unfavorable serum sex hormone profile. These observations provide an explanation for the previously reported interaction between baseline sex hormone levels and CEE?+?MPA odds ratios [13]. The analyses presented here excluded about 10 to 15% of placebo group, and about 5% of active treatment group cases and controls based on an IQR outlier criterion as applied to the differences between baseline and one-year log-analyte concentrations. These exclusion rates are consistent with a poor correspondence between split sample quality control specimens for about 10% of samples, especially at low sex hormone concentrations. To ensure that our outlier exclusion method was not unduly influencing results, the Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5 analyses were repeated using Rosner�s [20] �many-outlier detection procedure�, which relies on departure from normality. This method resulted in fewer outlier exclusions, about 2 to 4% in the placebo groups and almost none in the active treatment groups. The analytic results with this less restrictive outlier detection approach were quite similar to those shown in Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5. A modest difference arose in the Table  5 analysis where the HR (95% CI) for a doubling of estrone from baseline to one-year was 0.68 (0.44, 1.05), as compared to 0.57 (0.35, 0.95) in Table  5. The mechanisms whereby MPA would have such a dominant effect on breast cancer risk remain to be elucidated. MPA is a potent progestin with high affinity for progesterone and androgen receptors, and with little estrogen receptor affinity. It circulates in a form that is 88% bound to albumin, and is not bound by SHBG [21]. MPA could exert direct intracellular effects on division rates of breast ductal epithelial cells in a manner that achieves a high cell division rate regardless of the other sex hormone concentrations. A related possibility is that MPA sensitizes the proliferative response to low doses of estradiol [13]. The analyses presented here suggest that the collective changes in sex hormones with CEE contribute strongly to the observed breast cancer risk reduction [5-7] in the WHI trial. It is plausible that the roughly two-fold increase in SHBG with CEE substantially offsets the corresponding large increase in serum estrogens in their effects on breast ductal epithelial cells. The upper portion of Table  5 provides some modest support for this line of reasoning, and may raise concerns about potential breast cancer risks with the trend toward use of transdermal estradiol, which does not materially increase SHBG in a first-pass hepatic effect, but substantially increases serum estradiol. Moreover, both oral and transdermal estradiols increase serum estradiol to a greater extent than does CEE. The detailed analyses shown in the lower portion of Table  5 suggest that an additional mechanism may be at play with CEE. Specifically, women having a relatively large estrone increase with CEE use have a reduced (P?=?0.03) breast cancer risk. This observation could align with the intriguing hypothesis that estrogen exposure following a sufficient period of estrogen deprivation induces apoptosis of nascent breast tumor cells [22]. Note, however, that the increases in SHBG and serum estrogens with CEE use are highly correlated (for example, correlations (95% CIs) of 0.73 (0.66, 0.79) between (log-transformed) estradiol and estrone changes; and 0.59 (0.59, 0.67) between estrone and SHBG changes in the control group women) making it challenging to distinguish among the changes in specific sex hormones in relation to breast cancer risk. The fact that the estrone change stands out in Table  5, in spite of these statistical challenges, is interesting and merits replication in other settings. The strengths of this study are the randomized, controlled design of the WHI hormone therapy trials of adequate size, the quality sex hormone data assessment, and the ability to study CEE and CEE?+?MPA results side-by-side. Weaknesses include the absence of measurements on the biological changes resulting from the use of MPA. Conclusions In summary, post-treatment changes in serum estrogens and SHBG concentrations, or changes in the association of such concentrations with disease risk, have the potential to substantially explain both the elevation in breast cancer risk with CEE?+?MPA and the reduction in risk with CEE. The CEE data suggest that a roughly two-fold increase in SHBG may offset risk that may otherwise attend corresponding major serum estrogen increases, and also support the observation [9] that estrogen exposure following a sustained period of estrogen deprivation reduces risk [22]. However, when MPA is added to the hormone therapy regimen, the risk variations otherwise associated with these sex hormone levels are no longer evident, and an important increase in breast cancer risk follows, especially among women who would otherwise be at relatively low risk. Whether different formulations or routes of delivery of HT will provide similar results is unknown and also warrants further study.

Breast_Cancer "However, the involvement of estrogen signaling, a major signaling pathway profoundly influences mammary carcinogenesis, in regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells has not been well established, presumably since expression of estrogen receptor-? (ER-?) in breast cancer stem/progenitor cells remains controversial. It was reported that stem-like cells isolated from normal mammary gland and breast cancer tissues lack expression of the full-length ER-? [11], [12]. However, Clarke et.al reported that ER-? is expressed in putative normal breast stem/progenitor cells enriched by the �side population� method [13]. Despite the fact that ER expression in mammary stem cells is not clear, the significance of estrogen signaling for normal development and growth of the mammary gland is well established by studies in human and animal, which was explained as though indirect paracrine pathways [14]�[17]. Previously, we identified and cloned a novel variant of ER-?, which has a molecular weight of 36-kDa. Thus, we have named it ER-?36 [18], [19]. This ER-? variant differs from the original 66 kDa ER-? (ER-?66) because it lacks both transcriptional activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2) but retains the DNA-binding domain and partial ligand-binding domain [18]. It possesses a unique 27 amino acid stretch at the C-terminus to replace the last 138 amino acids of ER-?66. ER-?36 is mainly expressed at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, and mediates non-genomic estrogen and antiestrogen signaling such as activation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [19], [20]. Using a specific anti-ER-?36 antibody, we previously found that ER-?36 is expressed in specimens from both ER-positive and �negative breast cancer patients [19], [21]�[23]. Recently, we reported that ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling is critical for malignant growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells [24]. We also reported that ER-?36 expression is required for maintenance of the ALDH1-positive stem-like cells in ER-negative breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells [25], suggesting that ER-?36 is important in maintenance of the stem-like cells from ER-negative breast cancer. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling in regulation of the stem-like cells from ER-positive breast cancer are unknown. Here, we show that ER-?36 is expressed in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells, and ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling positively regulates ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. Materials and Methods Reagents and Antibodies The 17?-estradiol (E2?) was purchased from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). The GSK-3? inhibitor IX, the AKT inhibitor IV, and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The ER-?36 antibody was generated and characterized as described before [(19]. The ?-actin antibody (1�19), anti-CK18 (DC-10) and anti-CD 10 (H-321) antibodies, anti-PCNA antibody (FL-261), the goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP, the goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP and the donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The ER-? antibody (ERAb-16) was purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). The antibodies for AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), GSK-3?.27C?1., p-GSK-3?.D85E12., ?-Catenin (D10AB) and p-?-Catenin (thr41/Ser45) were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The ALDH1 antibody (#61194) was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). PerCP-Cy�5.5 mouse anti-human CD44 (clone C26) and PE mouse anti-human CD24 (clone ML5) were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (A-11008) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 antibody (A-31570) were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cell culture, Establishment of stable cell lines, and Growth assay MCF7 and T47D cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells and their derivatives were cultured in Improved Minimal Essential Medium (IMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino-acids, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and 2 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma, St. Louis). All cells were maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. MCF7 cells with forced expression of recombinant ER-?36 and with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression were established and characterized as described before [26], [27]. To establish stable cell lines with knocked-down expression of ER-?36 from T47D cells, we constructed an ER-?36 specific shRNA expression vector by cloning the DNA oligonucleotides 5?-GATGCCAATAGGTACTGAATTGATATCCGTTCAGTACCTATTGGCAT-3? targeting the sequence in the 3?UTR of ER-?36 gene into the pRNAT-U6.1/Neo expression vector from GenScript Corp. Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, T47D cells transfected with the empty expression vector and ER-?36 shRNA expression vector were selected with 500 �g/ml G418 for three weeks, and more than 20 individual clones from transfected cells were pooled, examined for ER-?36 expression with Western blot analysis and retained for experiments. Tumorsphere formation, Self-renewal and Growth assays To establish tumorspheres, cells were seeded onto Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 6-well plate (Corning Incorporated, CA) at 10,000 cells/ml and cultured seven days in the tumorsphere medium: phenol-red free DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1� B-27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (ProSpec, NJ), 0.5 �g/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma). Tumorspheres were collected, washed with PBS, and incubated with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%/0.5 mM) for two minutes at 37�C to dissociated cells, and cells were counted using the ADAM automatic cell counter (Digital Bio, Korea). To assess the self-renewal of the stem-like cells, tumorspheres were dissociated and cell number was determined. The cells from 1st generation of tumorspheres were seeded onto Ultra-Low Attachment 6-well plate at 5,000 cells/ml and cultured seven days in the tumorsphere medium to form 2nd generation tumorspheres. The cells were then passed once a week for 3rd and 4th generation tumorspheres. The number of tumorspheres and dissociated cells were counted using a Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and the ADAM automatic cell counter, respectively. For estrogen stimulation assays, tumorspheres were treated with 0.1 nM E2? or vehicle (ethanol) as a control. Three dishes were used for each group and all experiments were repeated three times. Flow Cytometry Analysis For CD44+/CD24? cell analysis, single cell suspension washed with cold PBS/1% BSA were incubated with PerCP-Cy�5.5 mouse anti-human CD44 and PE mouse anti-human CD24 in PBS/1% BSA for 30 minutes at 4�C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in cold PBS/1% BSA and re-suspended in cold PBS/1% BSA for flow cytometry analysis. DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay T47D and MCF7 cells were transfected with a p2�ERE-Luc reporter plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Katarine Pettersson at Karolinska Institute, Sweden) using FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Tumorspheres were transfected with electroporation using a pipette-type electroporator (MicroPorator MP-100, Digital Bio., Korean) as the manufacture recommended. All transfection included a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) to establish transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or 0.1 nM of E2? for 6, 12 and 24 hours. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activities were determined and normalized using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Western Blot Analysis Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with the RIPA buffer containing 1% proteinase inhibitor cocktail solution and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail solution (Sigma). The cell lysates were boiled for 5 minutes in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel-loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and visualized with the corresponding secondary antibodies and the ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes, blocked in 1% BSA for 30 minutes, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4�C overnight. Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 were then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and mounted with 10 mg/ml DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) (Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous mountant (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and photographed using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Eclipss E600). Tumor Seeding Assays in Nude Mice All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Creighton University and were performed in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. To assess tumor-seeding efficiency, cells in a serial dilution (1�102, 1�103, 1�104 and 1�105) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel and inoculated subcutaneously into the mammary fatpad of ovariectomized female nude mice (5�6 weeks old, strain CDI nu/nu, Charles River Breeding Laboratory). The mice were implanted with 0.35 mg/60-day slow-release 17?-estradiol pellets or placebos (Innovative Research of American, Sarasota, Florida) as controls. Mice were monitored twice a week for tumor growth. At the end of the experiments, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were removed and weighed, Statistical Analysis Data were summarized as the mean � standard deviation (S.D.) using GraphPad InStat software program. Statistical analysis was performed using paired-samples t-test, or ANOVA followed by the Student�Newman�Keuls testing and the significance was accepted for P values less than 0.05. Results Estrogen Expands the Population of ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem/Progenitor Cells To examine the effects of estrogen signaling on growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells, we used the well-characterized ER-positive breast cancer MCF7 and T47D cells as models. Both MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with or without 0.1 nM of E2? for five days. The CD44+/CD24? stem-like cell populations in these cells were assessed with flow cytometry. We found that estrogen treatment significantly increased the CD44+/CD24? cell population in both MCF7 and T47D cells (Figure 1A). We then cultured both MCF7 and T47D cells in the tumorsphere medium and under suspension conditions to form tumorspheres. We found that E2? treatment also increased the CD44+/CD24? cell populations in tumorspheres from these cells (Figure 1A). We also found that E2? treatment markedly increased the size and number of the tumorspheres as well as the number of cells in the tumorspheres (Figure 1B and C). Our results thus suggested that estrogen signaling increases the population of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g001 Figure 1 Estrogen expands the population of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. ER-positive breast cancer MCF7 and T47D cells were used. The tumorsphere formation assay and flow cytometry analysis of the CD44? and CD24+ cells were used to assess the population of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. (A). Estrogen treatment increases the population of the CD44?/CD24+ cells in MCF7 and T47D cells. The monolayer (parental) and tumorspheres of MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 0.1 nM of E2? for five days. The population of CD44?/CD24+ cells in these cells were analyzed after staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. The representative results are shown on the upper panel. Lower panel: the columns represent the means of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P<0.05 for vehicle treated cells vs cells treated with E2?. (B).

ER-?36 Plays an Essential Role in Mitogenic Estrogen Signaling of ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem/Progenitor Cells We then examined ER-?36 function in the stem/progenitor cells derived from ER-positive breast cancer cells. MCF7 and T47D cells transfected with the empty expression vector (MCF7/V and T47D/V), MCF7 and T47D cells with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression (MCF7/Si36 and T47D/Si36), and MCF7/36 and T47D/36 cells with high levels of recombinant ER-?36 expression were used (Figure 2A). The CD44+/CD24? cell populations in parental MCF7 and T47D cells as well as different variants treated with or without E2? for five days were assessed. We found that in the MCF7 and T47D cells that express high levels of ER-?36, MCF7/36 and T47D/36, the populations of CD44+/CD24? cells were significantly increased compared to the control cells transfected with the empty expression vector, suggesting that ER-?36 is involved in positive regulation of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells (Figure 2B). Estrogen treatment further increased the populations of CD44+/CD24? stem-like cells in MCF7/36 and T47D/36 cells (Figure 2B). We also examined the CD44+/CD24? cell populations in the tumorspheres formed by these cells treated with or without E2?. We found that in the tumorspheres formed by MCF736 and T47D/36 cells, the populations of CD44+/CD24? cells were dramatically increased compared to the control MCF7/V and T47D/V cells, which was further increased by estrogen treatment (Figure 2B). However, we found that the cells with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression, MCF7/Si36 and T47D/Si36, exhibited decreased populations of the CD44+/CD24? cell and weakly responded to estrogen treatment (Figure 2B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g002 Figure 2 ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling positively regulates ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.

(B). ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling increases the population of the CD44?/CD24+ cells. The monolayer (parental, P) and tumorspheres (T) of MCF7 and T47D variants were treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 0.1 nM of E2? for five days. The population of CD44?/CD24+ cells in these cells were analyzed after staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies.

The numbers of tumorspheres and cells from dissociated tumorspheres of different cell variants were determined. The columns represent the means of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P<0.05 for cells treated with vehicle vs cells treated with E2?. We then tested the capability of these cells to form tumorspheres. We found that in the absence of estrogen, the MCF7/36 and T47D/36 cells formed more and bigger tumorspheres compared to the control cells transfected with the empty expression vector (Figure 2C, D). Estrogen treatment further increased the number and size of tumorspheres formed by these cells (Figure 2C, D). The MCF7/Si36 and T47D/Si36 cells, however, formed less and smaller size tumorspheres compared to the control cells, and these cells responded poorly to estrogen stimulation (Figure 2C, D). We also collected tumorspheres, dissociated cells of the tumorspheres and assessed cell number. We found that in the MCF7 and T47D cells with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression, the cell numbers in tumorspheres were dramatically decreased compared to the control cells and were not increased in response to estrogen treatment (Figure 2E). On the other hand, in the MCF7 and T47D cells with forced expression of ER-?36, the number of cells in tumorspheres were significantly increased compared to the control cells and were further increased in response to estrogen treatment (Figure 2E). These results strongly indicated that the ER-positive breast cancer cells with high levels of ER-?36 expression contain higher percentage of stem/progenitor cells, and ER-?36 plays a critical role in estrogen-stimulated growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. ER-?36-mediated Estrogen Signaling Positively Regulates the Self-renewal of ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem Cells According to the stem cell model, stem cells divide asymmetrically to maintain homeostasis of the stem cell pool, a process called self-renewal, while the growth of the bulk population relies on progenitor cells. To examine whether ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling also influences the self-renewal of ER-positive breast cancer stem cells, we studied the tumorsphere formation of MCF7 and T47D cells as well as their derivatives with different levels of ER-?36 expression through serial passages in the absence or presence of estrogen. The cells were treated with vehicle or E2? at the time of each seeding. All viable cells were determined at the end of each passage and seeded for next passage for a total of four passages. We found that the MCF7 and T47D control cells transfected with the empty expression vector produced more tumorspheres in 2nd, 3rd and 4th generations in the absence of estrogen while estrogen treatment further increased the number of tumorspheres in each generation (Figure 3A, B). Compared to the vector control cells, MCF7/36 and T47D/36 cells generated much more breast cancer stem/progenitor cells in 2nd, 3rd and 4th generations of the self-renewal in the absence of estrogen, and estrogen treatment further enhanced growth of these cells (Figure 3A, B). In the absence and presence of estrogen, MCF7/Si36 and T47D/Si36 failed to generate more tumorspheres in each generation (Figure 3A, B). We also dissociated tumorspheres and determined the cell number. We found that cell numbers were increased more dramatically than the tumorsphere number in both cell lines, especially in the presence of estrogen (Figure 3C, D). Our results thus suggested that ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling positively regulates the self-renewal of ER-positive breast cancer stem cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g003 Figure 3 ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling stimulates the self-renewal of ER-positive breast cancer stem cells. Long-term expansion of MCF7 (A.C) and T47D (B, D) variant cells in the presence of vehicle (ethanol) or 0.1 nM of E2?. The cells from tumorspheres were passed once a week for four generations. The numbers of tumorspheres and cells from dissociated tumorspheres were determined. The numbers of tumorspheres and cells from tumorspheres from the control cells transfected with the empty expression vector and treated with vehicle were arbitrarily set as 1. Three dishes were used for each group and the experiments were repeated three times. The columns represent the means of three experiments; bars, SE. ER-?36-mediated Rapid Estrogen Signaling Enhances the Tumor-Seeding Efficiency of ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem/Progenitor Cells Previously, MCF7-derived tumorsphere cells were reported to be more tumorigenic than the parental cells [28]. To assess the involvement of ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling in tumor seeding efficiency of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells, we evaluated the tumor forming potential of tumorsphere cells derived from MCF7 and T47D cells and their variants with different levels of ER-?36 expression using in vivo tumorigenic assay. We first enriched the breast cancer stem/progenitor cells using the tumorsphere formation assay. The tumorsphere cells were then injected in serial limiting dilution (1�102, 1�103, 1�104 and 1�105 cells) into the mammary fatpad of ovariectomized female nude mice that were implanted with 0.35 mg/60-day slow-release 17?-estradiol or placebo pellets. In the absence of estrogen, tumorsphere cells from MCF7/V cells formed tumors at efficiency of four out of six mice and five out of six mice injected with 1�104 and 1�105 cells, respectively while MCF7/Si36 cells generated small tumors in four out of six mice only when 1�105 cells was injected (Figure 4, Table S1). The tumorsphere cells from MCF7/36 cells, however, had high tumor initiating potential; forming tumors (5/6) at 1�103 cells in the absence of estrogen. In the presence of estrogen, however, tumorsphere cells from MCF7/36 cells exhibited potent tumor-initiating efficiency, and generated tumors at 100 cells while MCF7V cells required 1,000 cells to generated tumors. We also found that MCF7/Si36 cells generated smaller tumors than the tumors formed by the control MCF7/V cells (Figure 4, Table S1). Similar results were also obtained in tumorsphere cells derived from T47D cell variants (Figure 4, Table S1). Our results thus strongly suggested that ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling enhances the tumor-initiating efficiency of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g004 Figure 4 ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling enhances the tumor-seeding efficiency of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. Different variants of MCF7 and T47D cells at limited dilutions were implanted in the mammary fatpad of the ovariectomized female mice supplemented with estrogen or placebo pellets. The tumor-seeding efficiency was examined by measurement of tumor weight. The data represent the mean � SE observed in six mice in each group. ER-?36-mediated Estrogen Signaling Induced Proliferation of Luminal Epithelial Lineage Specific ER-positive Breast Cancer Progenitor Cells Breast cancer stem cells are able to differentiate into both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells [3]. We investigated the differentiation lineages of the stem cells derived from different MCF7 and T47D derivatives in the presence and absence of estrogen. Single cell suspensions from tumorspheres plated on collagen-coated coverslips or intact tumorspheres in suspension culture were treated with or without E2?for five days, and the indirect immunofluoresces assay was performed to determine the effects of estrogen on differentiation lineages of these cells using cytokeratin 18 (CK18) for luminal epithelial cells and CD10 for myoepithelial cells. We found that tumorsphere cells plated on collagen-coated coverslips were fully differentiated into either luminal epithelial or myoepithelial lineages, and estrogen treatment had less or no effect on the differentiation (Figure S1), suggesting that estrogen treatment was unable to influence differentiation induced by cell attachment. We then assessed the effects of E2? on the spontaneous differentiation occurred in tumorspheres under suspension culture. In tumorspheres formed by MCF7 cells, we found that estrogen treatment increased the population of the cells that were stained positive for CK18 but without effect on the cells positive for CD10 (Figure 5A). We also found that estrogen treatment increased more number of cells expressing CK18 in MCF7/36 cells compared with MCF7/V cells (Figure 5A) while estrogen only slightly increased CK18 positive cells in MCF7/Si36 cells. Similar results were also observed in T47D cell variants; T47D/Si36 cells failed to respond to estrogen (Figure 5B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g005 Figure 5 ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling induced proliferation of luminal epithelial lineage specific ER-positive breast cancer progenitor cells. (A. B). Indirect Immunofluorescent staining for CK18 (red) or CD10 (red) in variants derived from MCF7 and T47D cells treated with vehicle or E2?. DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclear region. (C). Indirect Immunofluorescent staining for CK18 (red) or PCNA (green) in MCF7 cells treated with vehicle or E2?. DAPI (blue) was used to indicate the cell nuclei. To further examine whether estrogen treatment induces differentiation of breast cancer stem cells or increases proliferation of breast cancer progenitor cells that were in luminal epithelial lineage, we tested if the cells stained positive for CK18 were still proliferative. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed to examine the co-expression of CK18 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for cell proliferation. We found that in MCF7 cells, the number of both PCNA and CK18 positive cells was low in the absence of estrogen. After estrogen treatment, however, the number of cells co-expressing both PCNA and CK18 was markedly increased (Figure 5C), indicating estrogen stimulates proliferation of luminal epithelial lineage specific breast cancer progenitor or intermediate cells. The PI3K/AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin Signaling Pathway is Involved in ER-?36-mediated Mitogenic Estrogen Signaling of ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem/Progenitor Cells We also investigated the underlying mechanism of ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We treated tumorspheres formed by MCF7 and T47D cells with E2? and performed Western blot analysis using various phosphorylation specific for the AKT, GSK-3? and ?-catenin. We found that estrogen induced the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin signaling pathway in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells, which was attenuated by the AKT inhibitor (Figure 6A). We then included chemical inhibitors for the PI3K, AKT and GSK3? during estrogen stimulation and found that inhibition of the PI3K, AKT and GSK3? attenuated estrogen-stimulated growth of the stem/progenitor cells (Figure 6B). However, in the tumorspheres derived from MCF7/Si36 and T47D/Si36, estrogen failed to induce the AKT phosphorylation (Figure 6C). Our results thus indicated that the PI3K/AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin signaling pathway is involved in ER-?36-mediated mitogenic estrogen signaling of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g006 Figure 6 The PI3K/AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin signaling pathway is involved in ER-?36-mediated mitogenic estrogen signaling of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.

(B). The effects of different inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3? pathway on estrogen-stimulated growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.

After seven days, cell numbers from dissociated tumorspheres were determined. The columns represent the means of three experiments; bars, SE. The Expression and Genomic Function of ER-?66 are Down-regulated in ER-positive Breast Cancer Stem/Progenitor Cells Since the expression and potential function of ER-?66 in the breast cancer stem/progenitor cells remains controversial, we decided to study the expression pattern and possible function of ER-?66 in tumorsphere cells derived from MCF7 and T47D cells that express high levels of endogenous ER-?66. To assess the expression levels of ER-?66 and ER-?36 in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells, we performed Western blot analysis with cell lysates from tumorspheres. We found that the expression levels of ER-?36 protein were dramatically increased in tumorspheres from MCF7 and T47D cells while ER-?66 expression was down-regulated compared to parental cells (Figure 7A). In addition, we also found that the expression levels of ALDH1 and the basal levels of the AKT and GSK3? phosphorylation were markedly increased in tumorspheres (Figure 7A). The expression levels of growth receptors EGFR and HER2 were also increased in tumorspheres (Figure 7A). When the tumorspheres derived from MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, the steady state level of ER-?66 protein was dramatically increased in both parental cells and tumorshphere cells (Figure 7B), suggesting that degradation of ER-?66 protein by the proteasome system is involved in regulation of the steady state levels of ER-?66, which was enhanced in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We then examined the expression patterns of ER-?66 and 36 in parental and tumorsphere cells using the indirect immunofluorescence staining. We found that ER-?36 is expressed at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm of both parental and tumorsphere cells (Figure 7C). ER-?66, however, exhibited a predominant nuclear staining in the parental MCF7 and T47D cells while a weak cytoplasm staining was also observed in T47D cells. In tumorsphere cells, ER-?66 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm (Figure 7C), indicating a great portion of ER-?66 protein was redistributed to the cytoplasms of ER-positive tumorsphere cells. When the parental MCF7 and T47D cells, and their tumorsphere cells were transfected with a ERE containing luciferase reporter plasmid and treated with or without estrogen, we found that estrogen-induced transcription activities of ER-?66 were dramatically reduced in tumorsphere cells compared to parental cells (Figure 7D), indicating the genomic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-?66 is attenuated in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.g007 Figure 7 The expression and genomic function of ER-?66 are down-regulated in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. (A). Western blot analysis of the expression of different proteins in the monolayer cells (parental) and tumorspheres of the MCF7 and T47D cells. (B). Western blot analysis of ER-?66 expression in monolayer (parental) and tumorspheres of the MCF7 and T47D cells treated with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (100 nM) for 12 hours. (C).

The monolayer cells (parental) and tumorspheres of the MCF7 and T47D cells were transfected with the ERE luciferase report plasmid (2 �g). Twenty-four hours later, 0.1 nM of E2? was added and incubated for indicated time periods. The luciferase activities were assayed and normalized using a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid. Two replicates were used in each experiment. Columns: means of four independent experiments; bars, SE. The luminal compartment of mammary gland could be separated into ER-?66 positive and negative cells. The ER-?66 positive luminal cells express prolactin and progesterone receptor, and more luminal cytokeratins than ER-?66 negative luminal cells [11]. MCF7 cells were cultured in suspension culture for three and seven days to form tumorspheres. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed to examine the expression of CK18 and ER-?66 in cells from the tumorspheres. We found that in the cells cultured for three days, CK18 was highly expressed, and ER-?66 was expressed mainly in the cell nucleus (Figure S2). In the tumorspheres cultured for seven days, however, a great portion of ER-?66 was redistributed from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm and the signals for CK18 was diminished (Figure S2), indicating a correlation between cytoplasmic distribution of ER-?66 and downregulation of cells expressing CK18. Taken together, our results strongly suggested that ER-?66-mediated genomic estrogen signaling is important in cell differentiation, which is attenuated in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells presumably through re-distribution and down-regulation of ER-?66 protein. ER-?36 Expression is Positively Correlated to ALDH1"
Breast_Cancer "Expression in Specimens from Breast Cancer Patients To further determine if ER-?36 is involved in positive regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells in vivo, we examined the expression correlation of ER-?36 with ALDH1. We examined ER-?36 expression in sixty-eight specimens from breast cancer patients with the immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and found that 34 out of 68 cases (50%) exhibited ER-?36 expression, predominantly in a cytoplasmic and membranous pattern (Figure S3, Table 1). The mean percentage of the ER-?36-positive cells was 53% and the majority of the cases showed moderate to strong ER-?36 staining. ALDH1 was detected in 30 cases (44%), 20 of which co-expressed ER-?36. There was a positive correlation between ER-?36 and ALDH1 expression (P<0.01, x25.96). ER-?66 was expressed in 32 cases (47%), there was no correlation between ER-?66 and ALDH1 expression. These results suggested that ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling plays an important role in regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells in vivo. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088034.t001 Table 1 The relationship between ER-?36, ER-?66 and ALDH1 in sixty-eight patients. ER-?36 ER-?66 + ? X 2 P + ?

The results showed that ER-?36 had a positive correlation with ALDH1 (P<0.01, ?25.96). There were no correlations between ER-?36 and ER-?66, and between ER-?66 and ALDH1. Discussion In this study, the breast cancer stem/progenitor cells enriched from ER-positive breast cancer MCF7 and T47D cells were used as models to investigate their responses to estrogen. Here, we demonstrated that ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling plays an important role in maintenance and positive regulation of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We showed that estrogen treatment expanded the population of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells and also stimulated the self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells, both of which were mediated by ER-?36. Knockdown of ER-?36 expression diminished tumor-seeding efficiency of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We also showed that ER-?36 expression was markedly increased in the stem/progenitor cells enriched from ER-positive breast cancer cells accompanied by high levels of ALDH1, EGFR and HER2 as well as high levels of AKT and GSK3? phosphorylation. Finally, we presented evidence to indicate that the ER-? (ER-?66), was re-distributed outside of the cell nuclei, and its expression and genomic transcription activity were attenuated in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. It is increasingly recognized that breast cancer has a population of cancer stem/progenitor cells that maintains tumor growth [29], [30]. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of estrogen signaling in regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells are not clear. Mammary stem cells of human and mouse are highly responsive to estrogen signaling, although they usually show a receptor negative phenotype for ER-? and PR [31], [32]. A paracrine signaling model was proposed to explain the effects of estrogen signaling in mammary stem/progenitor cells [16], [17]. Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, that estrogen positively regulated ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells via ER-?36-mediated rapid signaling pathway. Expression of the full-length ER-?66 in the stem-like cells isolated from normal mammary gland and breast cancer tissues is controversial [11]�[13]. Here, using the well-established ER-positive breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that ER-?66 protein was re-distributed from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm and was destabilized presumably through the proteasome degradation system in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. As a result, the transcription activity of ER-?66 was attenuated in these cells. Thus, although ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells may retain ER-?66 expression, its function in genomic estrogen signaling may be diminished through redistribution and destabilization of the protein. Previously, it was reported that ER-?66 positive luminal cells form a differentiated luminal compartment that express more luminal cytokeratins than ER-?66 negative luminal cells in mammary gland [17]. ER-?66 is often co-expressed with GATA3 in breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines [33]�[35]. GATA3 is a critical regulator of luminal differentiation that maintains the differentiation of the luminal cells in the mammary gland [36], [37]. Our finding here that redistribution and down-regulation of ER-?66 were associated with decreased number of cells positive for CK18 in tumorspheres from ER-positive breast cancer cells highlighted an important role of ER-?66 in differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. Here, we found that estrogen treatment increased both the numbers and sizes of tumorspheres from the ER-positive breast cancer cells, suggesting estrogen treatment expanded the pool of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells via ER-?36-mediated signaling. Stem cells maintain self-renewal and differentiation in two ways: asymmetric and symmetric cell division [38], [39]. Accumulating evidence suggested that dysregulation of asymmetric stem cell division is one of the reason for stem cell transformation [38], [39]. However, the mechanisms by which stem cells adapt symmetric division have not been fully understood. Cicalese et al. reported that breast cancer stem cells derived from ERBB2/HER2 transgenic mice exhibited an increased frequency of symmetric self-renewing cell divisions and implicated p53 is a master regulator of this process [40]. Here, we found that in the presence of estrogen, ER-positive breast cancer cells with forced expression of ER-?36 increased the populations of breast cancer stem cells as evidenced by increased sizes and numbers of tumorspheres formed by these cells. However, cells with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression failed to increase the populations of stem/progenitor cells in response to estrogen while still retained the ability of the self-renewal. Since there are no specific markers to differentiate breast cancer stem, progenitor, and intermediate cells (non-stem proliferative cells), it is difficult to determine which cell populations that estrogen stimulates. However, the results that estrogen treatment increased both size and number of tumorspheres formed by ER-positive breast cancer cells and CK18 positive cells still underwent estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation suggested that ER-?36-mediated estrogen signaling may stimulate proliferation of breast cancer stem, progenitor and intermediate cells, and also suggested that ER-?36 overexpression might be involved in symmetric stem cell division. The genomic or classic estrogen-signaling pathway mediated by ER-?66 is prevailingly thought to be responsible for the initiation and progression of breast cancer. However, we found that knock-down of ER-?36 expression in the ER-positive breast cancer cells diminished the tumor-seeding efficiency of the breast cancer stem/progenitor cells and the genomic estrogen-signaling mediated by ER-?66 is attenuated in the ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. Additionally, the nuclear expression of ER-?66 is correlated with differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. Our results are in good agreement with a recent report that knock-down of ER-?66 expression in MCF7 cells using the shRNA method was without effect on tumorsphere formation and tumor-seeding potential in nude mice [41]. Together, these results suggested that ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling plays an important role in maintenance and regulation of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells while ER-?66-mediated genomic estrogen signaling is involved in determination of luminal epithelial lineage specific differentiation. Recently, we reported that ER-positive breast cancer cells expressing high levels of ER-?36 are more resistant to antiestrogen tamoxifen [27], consistent with our previous report that the breast cancer patients with tumors expressing high levels of ER-?36 less benefited from tamoxifen therapy compared to those with low levels of ER-?36 expression, and ER-?36 expression is significantly associated with HER2 expression [22], suggesting that increased ER-?36 expression is one of the underlying mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance. Here, we found that ER-?36 is highly expressed in ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells and plays an important role in positive regulation of these cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells may be resistant to antiestrogen tamoxifen. In summary, our results provided strong evidence to support an important role of ER-?36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling in maintenance and regulation of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells and provided a rational for development of therapeutic approaches to restrict growth of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells by targeting ER-?36.

Cell culture, Establishment of stable cell lines, and Growth assay MCF7 and T47D cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells and their derivatives were cultured in Improved Minimal Essential Medium (IMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino-acids, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and 2 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma, St. Louis). All cells were maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. MCF7 cells with forced expression of recombinant ER-?36 and with knocked-down levels of ER-?36 expression were established and characterized as described before [26], [27]. To establish stable cell lines with knocked-down expression of ER-?36 from T47D cells, we constructed an ER-?36 specific shRNA expression vector by cloning the DNA oligonucleotides 5?-GATGCCAATAGGTACTGAATTGATATCCGTTCAGTACCTATTGGCAT-3? targeting the sequence in the 3?UTR of ER-?36 gene into the pRNAT-U6.1/Neo expression vector from GenScript Corp. Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, T47D cells transfected with the empty expression vector and ER-?36 shRNA expression vector were selected with 500 �g/ml G418 for three weeks, and more than 20 individual clones from transfected cells were pooled, examined for ER-?36 expression with Western blot analysis and retained for experiments. Tumorsphere formation, Self-renewal and Growth assays To establish tumorspheres, cells were seeded onto Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 6-well plate (Corning Incorporated, CA) at 10,000 cells/ml and cultured seven days in the tumorsphere medium: phenol-red free DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1� B-27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (ProSpec, NJ), 0.5 �g/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma). Tumorspheres were collected, washed with PBS, and incubated with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%/0.5 mM) for two minutes at 37�C to dissociated cells, and cells were counted using the ADAM automatic cell counter (Digital Bio, Korea). To assess the self-renewal of the stem-like cells, tumorspheres were dissociated and cell number was determined. The cells from 1st generation of tumorspheres were seeded onto Ultra-Low Attachment 6-well plate at 5,000 cells/ml and cultured seven days in the tumorsphere medium to form 2nd generation tumorspheres. The cells were then passed once a week for 3rd and 4th generation tumorspheres. The number of tumorspheres and dissociated cells were counted using a Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and the ADAM automatic cell counter, respectively. For estrogen stimulation assays, tumorspheres were treated with 0.1 nM E2? or vehicle (ethanol) as a control. Three dishes were used for each group and all experiments were repeated three times. Flow Cytometry Analysis For CD44+/CD24? cell analysis, single cell suspension washed with cold PBS/1% BSA were incubated with PerCP-Cy�5.5 mouse anti-human CD44 and PE mouse anti-human CD24 in PBS/1% BSA for 30 minutes at 4�C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in cold PBS/1% BSA and re-suspended in cold PBS/1% BSA for flow cytometry analysis. DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay T47D and MCF7 cells were transfected with a p2�ERE-Luc reporter plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Katarine Pettersson at Karolinska Institute, Sweden) using FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Tumorspheres were transfected with electroporation using a pipette-type electroporator (MicroPorator MP-100, Digital Bio., Korean) as the manufacture recommended. All transfection included a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) to establish transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or 0.1 nM of E2? for 6, 12 and 24 hours. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activities were determined and normalized using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Western Blot Analysis Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with the RIPA buffer containing 1% proteinase inhibitor cocktail solution and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail solution (Sigma). The cell lysates were boiled for 5 minutes in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel-loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and visualized with the corresponding secondary antibodies and the ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes, blocked in 1% BSA for 30 minutes, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4�C overnight. Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 were then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and mounted with 10 mg/ml DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) (Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous mountant (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and photographed using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Eclipss E600). Tumor Seeding Assays in Nude Mice All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Creighton University and were performed in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. To assess tumor-seeding efficiency, cells in a serial dilution (1�102, 1�103, 1�104 and 1�105 cells) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel and inoculated subcutaneously into the mammary fatpad of ovariectomized female nude mice (5�6 weeks old, strain CDI nu/nu, Charles River Breeding Laboratory). The mice were implanted with 0.35 mg/60-day slow-release 17?-estradiol pellets or placebos (Innovative Research of American, Sarasota, Florida) as controls. Mice were monitored twice a week for tumor growth. At the end of the experiments, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were removed and weighed.

Breast_Cancer "Background NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) plays a central role in catalyzing the two-electron reduction of quinoid compounds into hydroquinones. The NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism was found to correlate with a lower enzymatic activity, which may result in increased incidence of carcinomas including breast cancer. Previous studies investigating the association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk showed inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the possible association. Methods All studies published from January 1966 to February 2014 on the association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk were identified by searching electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM). The association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Ten studies with 2,773 cases and 4,076 controls were finally included in the meta-analysis. We did not observe a significant association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant increased breast cancer risk was found in Caucasians (Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.145, 95% CI?=?1.008�1.301, P?=?0.038; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.177, 95% CI?=?1.041�1.331, P?=?0.009). When stratified by source of control, significant increased breast cancer risk was found in population-based studies (Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.180, 95% CI?=?1.035�1.344, P?=?0.013; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.191, 95% CI?=?1.050�1.350, P?=?0.007). However, in subgroup analyses according to menopausal status, quality score, and HWE in controls, no any significant association was detected. Conclusions Our meta-analysis provides the evidence that the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism contributed to the breast cancer susceptibility among Caucasians. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.

In 2008 there were 182,460 women diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,480 women died of this disease [1]. In several developing countries, such as China, breast cancer has surpassed cervical cancer and become the leading cause of cancer death among females [2]. Though the exact mechanism of breast carcinogenesis is still unclear, it has been well accepted that oxidative stress resulting from excess reactive oxygen species and deficiency in antioxidant capabilities play important roles in breast cancer etiology [3,4]. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), also known as diphtheria toxin diaphorase (DT-diaphorase), is a cytosolic flavoenzyme which is present in human epithelial and endothelial tissues. NQO1 is considered as an anticancer enzyme because it protect cells from oxidative damage by preventing quinones from entering the one-electron reduction which is catalyzed by cytochrom b5 reductase or P450 reductase to generate semiquinone free radicals and reactive oxygen species [5]. On the contrary, with its unique property of transferring two electrons at a time by using either NADH or NADPH as reducing cofactor, NQO1 catalyze quinones and quinine-imines into hydroquinones, which are thought less toxic and easier to excrete when conjugated [6,7]. The NQO1 gene, mapped to chromosome 16q22.1, is 17.2 kb in length and contains 6 exons and 5 introns [8]. There were at least 270 SNPs in the NQO1 gene according to the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), including the most commonly occurring C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 609 in exon 6 (rs1800566, 609C?>?T), which results in a proline-to-serine amino-acid substitution at codon 187 (Pro187Ser) in the protein. It was reported that the variant T allele was associated with reduced NQO1 enzymatic activity in both human cell lines and primary human tissues [9,10]. Furthermore, there is a clear allele dosage effect of the NQO1 609 T genotypes on NQO1 enzymatic activity, with the variant homozygotes (TT) having the lowest, the heterozygotes (CT) having the intermediate, and the wild-type homozygotes (CC) having the highest NQO1 enzyme activity [11-13]. Given that the previous studies have consistently shown that the variant T allele resulted in reduced enzymatic activity, it was biologically reasonable to hypothesize a potential relationship between the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. In the past two decades, a number of molecular epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk, but the results remain inconsistent. Several studies have previously suggested that the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [14,15]. However, other studies have failed to confirm such an association [3,16]. In addition, a meta-analysis by Yuan et al. [17] found that the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism may contribute to breast cancer development in Caucasians. However, evidence was limited because only 6 studies were available at that time. In addition, only ethnicity was considered in the subgroup analysis and the source of heterogeneity was not explored in this study. As some new studies emerging [16,18,19], to provide the most comprehensive assessment of the associations between the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk, we performed an updated meta-analysis of all available studies with extensive exploration of the source of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses. Methods Search strategy We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) databases form January 1966 to February 2014 using the following search strategy: (�breast cancer�) and (�NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1�, or �NQO1�). There was no restriction on sample size, population, language, or type of report. All eligible studies were retrieved and their references were checked for other relevant studies. The literature retrieval was performed in duplication by two independent reviewers (Qiliu Peng and Yu Lu). When multiple publications reported on the same or overlapping data, we chose the most recent or largest population. When a study reported the results on different subpopulations, we treated it as separate studies in the meta-analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Studies included in the meta-analysis were required to meet the following criteria: (1) case�control or cohort studies which evaluated the association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk; (2) used an unrelated case�control design; (3) had an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) or other available data for estimating OR (95% CI); and (4) the control population did not contain malignant tumor patients. Studies were excluded if one of the following existed: (1) no control population; (2) duplicate of previous publication; and (3) insufficient information for data extraction. Data extraction Two authors (Qiliu Peng and Xue Qin) independently reviewed and extracted data from all eligible studies. Data extracted from eligible studies included the first author, year of publication, ethnicity, country of origin, genotyping method, source of control, matching criteria, breast cancer ascertainment, total numbers of cases and controls and genotype frequencies of cases and controls. Ethnic backgrounds were categorized as Caucasian, Asian, and Arab. When a study did not state the ethnic descendent or if it was impossible to separate participants according to such phenotype, the group reported was termed as �mixed ethnicity�. To ensure the accuracy of the information extracted, the two authors checked the data extraction results and reached consensus on all of the items. If different results generated, they would check the data again and have a discussion to come to an agreement. If these two authors could not reach a consensus, another author (Shan Li) was consulted to resolve the dispute and a final decision was made by the majority of the votes. Menopausal status was divided into premenopausal and postmenopausal and was additionally recorded for stratified analysis. Quality score evaluation The quality of eligible studies was evaluated independently by two authors (Qiliu Peng and Yu Lu) according to a set of predefined criteria (Table 1) based on the scale of Thakkinstian et al. [20]. The revised criteria cover the source of controls, representativeness of cases, ascertainment of breast cancer, total sample size, quality control of genotyping methods, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control population. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Scores ranged from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Articles with scores equal to or higher than 7 were considered �high-quality� studies, whereas those with scores less than 7 were considered �low-quality� studies. Table 1 Scale for quality assessment Criteria Score Representativeness of cases   Selected from cancer registry or multiple cancer center sites 2 Selected from oncology department or cancer institute 1 Selected without clearly defined sampling frame or with extensive inclusion/exclusion criteria 0 Source of controls   Population or community based 2 Both population-based and hospital-based/healthy volunteers/blood donors 1.5 Hospital-based controls without breast cancer 1 Cancer-free controls without total description 0.5 Not described 0 Ascertainment of breast cancer   Histological or pathological confirmation 2 Diagnosis of breast cancer by patient medical record 1 Not described 0 Sample size   >1000 2 200-1000 1 <200 0 Quality control of genotyping methods   Clearly described a different genotyping assay to confirm the data 1 Not described 0 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls 1 Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in controls 0.5 No checking for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium 0 Statistical analysis The strength of the association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The significance of the pooled OR was determined by a Z test and the p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The association of NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism with breast cancer risk was assessed using co-dominant model (Ser/Ser vs. Pro/Pro and Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro), recessive model (Ser/Ser vs. Ser/Pro?+?Pro/Pro), and dominant model (Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro). The ?2 based Q test was used to assess the heterogeneity among studies [21,22]. If the result of the Q test was P Q ?<?0.1, indicating the presence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) was used to estimate the summary ORs [21]; otherwise, when the result of the Q test was P Q ???0.1, indicating the absence of heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model (the Mantel�Haenszel method) was used [22]. To explore the sources of heterogeneity among studies, we performed logistic metaregression and subgroup analyses. The following study characteristics were included as covariates in the metaregression analysis: genotyping methods (PCR-RFLP vs. not PCR-RFLP), ethnicity (Caucasians vs. not Caucasians), source of controls (Hospital-based vs. Population-based), quality scores (High-quality vs. Low-quality), HWE status (Yes vs. No), and breast cancer ascertainment (pathologically or histologically confirmed vs. other diagnosis criteria). Subgroup analyses were conducted by ethnicity, menopausal status, quality score, source of control, and HWE in controls. Galbraith plots analysis was performed for further exploration of the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was performed by sequential removal of individual studies. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger�s regression asymmetry test. The distribution of the genotypes in the control population was tested for HWE using a goodness-of-fit ?2 test. All analyses were performed using Stata software, version 12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Result Study characteristics Base on our search criterion, 112 individual records were found, but only 11 full-text publications were preliminarily identified for further detailed evaluation. According to the exclusion criteria, 2 publications were excluded including 1 provide insufficient information for data extraction [23], and 1 was a meta-analysis [17]. Manual search of references cited in the published studies did not reveal any additional articles. As a result, a total of 9 relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis [3,14-16,18,19,24-26]. Among them, one of the eligible studies contained data on two ethnic groups [15], and we treated it independently. Therefore, a total of 10 separate comparisons including 2,773 breast cancer cases and 4,076 controls were finally included in our meta-analysis. The main characteristics of the studies are presented in Table 2. Of all the eligible studies, 6 were conducted in Caucasian populations, 3 were in Asians, and 1 was in Arabs. Six studies were population�based and 4 were hospital�based studies. All studies used validated methods including PCR-RFLP, PCR-SSCP, PCR-CTPP, TaqMan assay, and 5? exonuclease assay to genotype the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism. The breast cancer cases were histologically or pathologically confirmed in 7 of the eligible studies. The genotype distributions of the controls in 2 studies were not consistent with HWE [16,25].

Meta-analysis The results of meta-analysis of the association between NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk were shown in Table 3. We did not observe a significant association between the NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism and breast cancer risk when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (Ser/Ser vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.251, 95% CI 0.843�1.856, P?=?0.266; Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.015, 95% CI 0.860�1.198, P?=?0.860; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.058, 95% CI 0.899�1.245, P?=?0.498; Ser/Ser vs. Ser/Pro?+?Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.317, 95% CI 0.919�1.887, P?=?0.133). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, statistical significant increased breast cancer risk was found in Caucasians (Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.145, 95% CI?=?1.008�1.301, P?=?0.038; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.177, 95% CI?=?1.041�1.331, P?=?0.009; Figure 1), but not in Asians and Arabs. In stratified analysis by source of control, significant increased breast cancer risk was also found in population-based studies (Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.180, 95% CI?=?1.035�1.344, P?=?0.013; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR?=?1.191, 95% CI?=?1.050�1.350, P?=?0.007; Figure 2), but not in hospital-based studies. However, when stratified by menopausal status, quality score, and HWE in controls, statistical significant association was not detected in all subgroups.

Test of heterogeneity Statistical significant heterogeneity among studies was observed when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (Ser/Ser vs. Pro/Pro: P Q ?=?0.004; Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: P Q ?=?0.033; Ser/Ser?+?Ser/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: P Q ?=?0.023; Ser/Ser vs. Ser/Pro?+?Pro/Pro: P Q ?=?0.007; Table 3). To explore the sources of heterogeneity, we performed metaregression and subgroup analyses. Metaregression analysis of data showed that the genotyping methods, source of controls, ethnicity, quality scores, HWE status, and breast cancer ascertainment were not effect modifiers of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity, menopausal status, quality score, source of control, and HWE status showed that heterogeneity still existed among Caucasians, low quality studies, population-based studies, and studies consistent with HWE (Table 2). To further explore the source of heterogeneity, we performed Galbraith plots analysis to identify the outliers which might contribute to the heterogeneity. Our results showed that the study Menzel et al. [15] was the outlier in the overall populations. All P Q values were greater than 0.10 after excluding the study Menzel et al. [15] in the overall populations, Caucasians,"
Breast_Cancer "Indeed, TTD can deal with missing data by making underlying assumptions about whether the missing data reflect a deterioration of the patient's health status or not. Furthermore, the measure of TTD might be more familiar to clinicians because it is based on Kaplan�Meier survival curves and hazard ratios (HR)[15]. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of the recalibration component of RS on TTD estimations in patients with BC. The secondary objective was to examine the influence of baseline QoL expectations on TTD in patients with BC. Methods Patients A prospective multicenter randomized cohort study that included all women hospitalized for the diagnosis or treatment of primary BC or for a suspicion of BC was implemented in the cancer centers of Dijon, and Nancy, and in the university hospitals of Strasbourg and Reims. Patients were included between February 2006 and February 2008. Patients with other primary cancer sites than BC and patients already hospitalized or treated for BC were excluded. Only, women patients were included. Patients who declined the study or who were unable to give a written informed consent were excluded. All of the participants gave their written informed consent, and the protocol of the study was approved by the regional ethics committee (Comit� Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biom�dicale de Bourgogne) in 2005. Health related Quality of life assessments HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 [16] and the EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaires [17] at diagnosis (T0), at the end of the first hospitalization (T1) and, three (T2) and six months after the first hospitalization (T3). The QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific tool composed of 30 items which generate 15 scores: five scores of functional parameters, a financial difficulties scale, and eight scores for symptoms. The breast cancer module comprises 23 questions assessing disease symptoms and the side-effects of treatment. These scores vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for functional functions and from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) for symptom parameters. Patients were also asked to assess their QoL expectations at baseline using the following question: do you expect that your QoL: will not change globally, will deteriorate, will improve. Assessment of the recalibration component of RS using the then-test method Recalibration was assessed using the then-test method. This method requires patients to rate their previous health state from their current perspective [5], [18]. The order in which the QoL questionnaires, then-test and post-test, were administered was determined by randomization 1?1 with center stratification to assess the impact of the order of the questionnaires on RS estimates. In arm A, patients were asked to complete the questionnaires at time T (posttest), and then retrospectively (then-test) to assess baseline QoL at the end of the first hospitalization. In arm B, the order of the questionnaires was then-test/post-test. In this study, we did not compare patients according to randomized arm because previous study showed only a small impact of the ordre of the randomized arm on QoL scores [10]. Three then-tests were implemented (figure 1): two to retrospectively assess baseline QoL (measured at the end of the first hospitalization and 3 months after the first hospitalization) and one to retrospectively assess the three-month QoL (measured at 6 months). In other words, patients were asked to retrospectively assess their baseline QoL at T1 (then test1) and at T2 (then test 2), and to retrospectively assess their three-month QoL at T3 (then test 3).The mean differences between the assessment of the baseline QoL at the inclusion (pretest) and then test1 were calculated to assess recalibration at the end of the first hospitalization. In order to assess recalibration at 3 months, the mean differences between the assessment of the baseline QoL at the inclusion and thentest2 were calculated. Lastly, the mean differences between the three-month QoL and its retrospective assessment at 6 months (then-test3) were compared in other to assess recalibration in internal standards at 6 months. A + (or ?) mean difference between the �then-test and the pre-test� retrospectively reflects a higher (or lower) QoL level at baseline (or at 3 months) for the functional (or symptoms) dimensions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.g001 Figure 1 Quality of life data collection procedure. Statistical methods Patients' characteristics were described and compared according to the completion of baseline questionnaire in order to determine whether missing score at inclusion was dependent on patients' clinical or sociodemographic status. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to assess recalibration. Time to QoL deterioration All patients who had a baseline and at least one follow-up QoL assessment were included in the TTD analyses. The time to QoL deterioration (TTD) was defined as the time from inclusion in the study to the first 5-point [19] decrease in QoL scores according to baseline score. Patients were censored at the time of the last QoL completed if they had not deteriorated before that [14]. To take into account the recalibration component of RS, then-test assessments were used as reference scores when significant recalibration effects were observed. Therefore, if significant recalibration of baseline QoL was observed only at T1 (or at T2), analyses were done using then-test1 (or then-test2), as the reference score. In addition, then-test3 was used in TTD analyses (instead of three-month QoL), when significant recalibration of the three-month QoL was observed at T3. The TTD was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The TTD was described using medians and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significant difference between median TTD when recalibration component of RS was taken into account and median TTD when recalibration was not taken into account was assessed using bootstrap Kaplan-Meier estimate of median TTD. Nonparametric 95% confidence intervals for the difference in bootstrap Kaplan-Meier estimate of median TTD were computed. Differences between medians were considered statistically significant if their 95% confidence intervals did not include the value of 0. Cox regressions were applied to identify factors associated with TTD for each QoL dimension. All variables with an univariate Cox p value ?0.20 were eligible for multivariate Cox analyses. Cox multivariate analyses were stratified on the center of inclusion. The statistical significance level was set at p?=?0.05 for Cox models analyses and reduced to p?=?0.01 for the analysis performed with the then-test method in order to prevent false positive results due to the number of multiple comparisons performed with this method. Analyses were performed using STATA Statistics 11/Data Analysis Software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA) Results Patients Between February 2006 and February 2008, 381 patients were included. Patients' characteristics have been widely described elsewhere [10]. Briefly, the mean age was 58 years (SD?=?11.1), 124 (33%) patients underwent mastectomy, 131(34%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 155 (40%) received adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.t001 Table 1 Characteristics of patients according to the completion of quality of life questionnaire at baseline.

The clinical and pathological characteristics of these two populations were similar and are presented in Table 1. Only the center of inclusion was statistically different according to missing score. Response shift Retrospective assessments of baseline QoL The occurrence of recalibration effects differed according to the time of the retrospective assessment (T1 or T2) for 7 dimensions. For fatigue, appetite loss and the side effects of systemic therapy, with mean differences (MD) in QoL scores of ?1.8(p?=?0.0006), ?2.9(p?=?0.0081) and ?1.96(p?=?0.0001), respectively (Table 2), symptoms were significantly higher at inclusion than the retrospective assessment at T1 (then-test1). These differences were no longer statistically significant with the retrospective assessment of the baseline QoL at T2 (then-test 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.t002 Table 2 Significant changes in internal standards.

SD: standard deviation. *Wilcoxon matched pairs tests p value. Moreover, the MD in global health (GHS), role-functioning and social-functioning scores as well as body-image were not statistically significant with then-test1, but became significant with then-test2. Indeed, QoL scores for GHS, role-functioning, social-functioning and body-image were significantly higher at inclusion than the retrospective assessment at T2: MD?=??3.7(p?=? 0.0014), MD?=??6.3(p<0.0001), MD?=??3.86(p?=?0.0012) and MD?=??6.47(p?=?0.0001), respectively (Table 2). For emotional-functioning, cognitive-functioning, future perspectives, diarrhea and insomnia symptoms, the recalibration effects at T1 and T2 were similar (Table 2). QoL scores were higher for the retrospective assessments as compared to the baseline QoL level. MD between then-test2 and pretest scores were MD?=?6.89(p<0.0001), MD?=?3.09(p?=?0.0012) and MD?=?7.6(p<0.0001) for emotional-functioning, cognitive-functioning and future perspectives, respectively. Insomnia: MD?=??7.25(p?=?0.0001) and diarrhea: MD?=??2.9(p?=?0.0019) symptoms were significantly higher at inclusion the retrospective assessment (Table 2). Retrospective assessment of the three months QoL (then-test3) The retrospective assessment of 3-month QoL scores at T3 (then-test3), showed that MD between then-test 3 and 3-month scores were statistically different for most QoL dimensions (Table 2). For example, QoL scores were higher at the retrospective assessments (T3) than at 3 months for physical-functioning (MD?=?4.3) and role-functioning (MD?=?6.95). Furthermore, fatigue (MD?=??9.48), pain (MD?=??5.07), dyspnea (MD?=??3.25) and insomnia (MD?=??3.96) symptoms were significantly higher at 3 months than when evaluated retrospectively at T3. Time to QoL deterioration Medians TTD for the studied population are shown in table 3. Results showed that median TTD were significantly shorter when recalibration was not taken into account than when recalibration was taken into account for global health, role-functioning, social-functioning, body-image and side effects of systemic therapy (figure 2 a to f). For example for GHS, the median TTD increased from 3.1[2.9�3.3] when recalibration was not taken into account to 3.6[3.2�6.3] when it was (figure 2a). For role-functioning (figure 2b), the median TTD increased from 3.2[3.1�3.3] to 4.7[3.3�6.2] when recalibration was taken into account. For social functioning score (figure 2d), median TTD increased from 3.6 months to 6.3 months when recalibration was taken into account. For body image score (figure 2e), median TTD increased from 3.3 months to 6.2 months (table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.g002 Figure 2 Time to deterioration in QoL score in the studied population with response shift (RS) taken into account or not. a) for the general health score of the QLQ-C30. b) for the role functioning score of the QLQ-C30. c) for emotional functioning. d)for social functioning. e) for body image. f) for systematic therapy side effects. 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.t003 Table 3 Median TTD according recalibration of response shift.

NA: Not applicable (no significant recalibration). NR: Not reached. Inf: Infinite. However, for emotional-functioning dimension (figure 2c) median TTD was significantly longer when recalibration was not taken into account. Bootstrap Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference in median TTD was ?3.13[?3.8�?0.5]. For the other dimensions no statistically significant difference was found between median TTD. Univariate analyses of TTD Results of the univariate Cox analyses of TTD are reported in table S1 in File S1 for QLQ-C-30 score and table S2 in File S1 for QLQ-BR23 scores. An MCID of 5 points was used for these analyses. For example, for the body-image score, when recalibration was not taken into account, there was no beneficial effect on TTD of either SLNB or not undergoing radiotherapy. When recalibration was taken into account, women treated with SLNB had a significantly longer TTD than those treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND): HR?=?0.65[0.45�0.93]. Concerning radiotherapy, patients who did not receive treatment by radiotherapy had a significantly longer TTD than those who underwent radiotherapy. Cox multivariate analyses of TTD Multivariate Cox models analyses were done for all dimensions of the QLQ-C30 and BR-23 questionnaire. However, for parsimony of the presentation, only dimensions (of QLQ-C30 or BR23) where times to deterioration estimations were significantly influenced by factors are shown in table 4. For body-image, when RS was not taken into account, cox multivariate analyses showed that the modality of surgery was significantly associated with TTD. Patients who underwent mastectomy had a shorter TTD for body-image as compared to patient having conservative surgery: HR 1.8[1.3�2.5]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0096848.t004 Table 4 Multivariate cox regression analyses of time to QoL score deterioration for factors influencing significantly TTD.

When recalibration was taken into account for body-image, the association between TTD and the modality of surgery became non-statistically significant while radiotherapy became significantly associated with TTD. Patients who did not receive radiotherapy had a significantly longer TTD than did those who received radiotherapy: HR 0.60 [0.38�0.94]. Cox multivariate analyses showed that, expectation about QoL level at baseline was significantly associated with TTD. As example, when the recalibration component of RS was taken into account, QoL expectancy at baseline was significantly associated with TTD in GHS, physical-functioning, cognitive-functioning, social-functioning, and breast symptoms scales. Patients who expected a deterioration in their QoL at baseline had a significantly shorter TTD than patients who expected an improvement in their QoL at baseline HR: 1.60[1.05�2.45], HR: 1.95[1.33�2.86], HR: 1.64[1.07�2.52] and HR: 1.75[1.11�2.75] for GHS, physical, cognitive and social scores, respectively. Discussion In this study, we examined the impact of the recalibration component of response shift on TTD estimations of QoL scores in breast cancer patients. Our results underlined that BC patients' internal standards for assessing their QoL could change during the course of treatment and disease. The recalibration of BC patients' internal standards had a significant effect on Time to QoL score deterioration for six of the 23 dimensions. Indeed, the median TTD of the studied-population was underestimated for global health, role-functioning, social-functioning, body-image and side effects of systemic therapy when recalibration was not used as reference score to qualify QoL score deterioration. Regarding the emotional-functioning scale, the median TTD was overestimated when recalibration was not taken into account. Our results showed that, as compared to ALND SLNB modality was independently associated with longer TTD for arm symptoms, nausea and vomiting symptoms as well as systemic therapy side effects [14], [20]�[23]. Interestingly, for breast symptoms, our results showed that SLNB followed by complementary ALND resulted in a significantly shorter TTD than for ALND alone [14]. According the surgical modality, TTD was significantly associated with diarrhea symptoms when recalibration was take into account. In contrast, for body-image, we found a significant association between the type of surgery and TTD only when the recalibration effect was not take into account. To our knowledge, no study reporting the association between the type of surgery and QoL has considered the effect of the recalibration component of RS [24]�[27]. In addition, we suggest that radiotherapy could be independently associated with a shorter time to body-image deterioration, when RS into account. These results underline the requirement to assess impact of RS through sensibility analyses. Moreover, patients who expected deterioration or no change in their QoL level reported a significantly shorter TTD than patients who expected an improvement. Previous studies have also suggested that the high expectation of patients regarding health and QoL level, could predict better outcome [2], [28]�[31,]. Although, heterogeneity between studies clinical outcome, investigators have consistently and in a majority shown strong, statistically and clinically significant associations between patients' expectations and clinical recovery. However, the interpretation of this association remains unclear. Incorporating questions about patient expectations related to health and QoL in future trials should be promote to clarify the role for clinical outcomes. One of the limits of our study is that we focused on the recalibration component of response-shift only using then test method. Furthermore due to the retrospective assessment, a major limitation of the then-test method is its susceptibility to recall bias. Thereby, respondents are supposed to be able to remember their previous health and QoL level at the baseline assessment [18], [32]. The risk when using this approach could be that patients will miss to accurately recall their health and QoL level before the intervention (recall bias). Additionally, recent evidence has emerged amongst patients undertaking self-management interventions for chronic diseases that the then-test approach may contain psychometric flaws resulting from implicit theory of change, social desirability, halo effects and recall bias [33]. Including a comparison group when designing studies could help to achieve optimal use of the then-test approach. However, RS has been defined as a treatment-dependent phenomenon, pre-test, post-test and then-test scores of control subjects would only reflect effects due to history, maturation or testing. Thus, recalibration RS is only indicated if the difference between the then-test and pre-test scores are significantly larger in the experimental than in the control group [18]. Response shift has been explored over time in HRQoL through a variety of designs and statistical methods. Each of these methods is specific, with its own advantages, limitations and challenges. However, assessing response shift is of paramount importance in longitudinal HRQoL research. In conclusion, our study showed that BC patients' internal standards change during QoL follow-up. Since patients could accommodate to the treatment toxicities or disease progression over time, this could result in the attenuation or the inflation of treatment effect estimation. Therefore, cancer clinical trials must investigate the RS effect more deeply. We encourage to plan longitudinal QoL analyses taking it into account such effect to improve interpretation of the results. Our study also showed that baseline QoL expectations were associated with QoL deterioration in several dimensions. For this reason, health care providers should give adequate counselling and psychological support to the patients at the time of the diagnosis to prevent the early QoL level deterioration.

Background. Little information is available about survival outcomes of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant capecitabine-containing chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab. Patients and methods. One thousand and five hundred patients with early breast cancer were entered to the Finland Capecitabine trial (FinXX) between January 2004 and May 2007, and were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of adjuvant TX (docetaxel, capecitabine) followed by three cycles of CEX (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, capecitabine; TX-CEX) or three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil; T-CEF). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). The study protocol was amended in May 2005 while study accrual was ongoing to allow adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive cancer. Of the 284 patients with HER2-positive cancer accrued to FinXX, 176 (62.0%) received trastuzumab after amending the study protocol, 131 for 12 months and 45 for nine weeks. The median follow-up time was 6.7 years. Results. Patients with HER2-positive cancer who received trastuzumab had better RFS than those who did not (five-year RFS 89.2% vs. 75.9%; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23�0.72; p = 0.001). Patients treated with trastuzumab for 12 months or nine weeks had similar RFS. There was no significant interaction between trastuzumab administration and the type of chemotherapy. Four (2.3%) patients treated with trastuzumab had heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, three of these received capecitabine. Conclusion. Adjuvant trastuzumab improves RFS of patients treated with TX-CEX or T-CEF. Few patients had cardiac failure. Adjuvant trastuzumab improves disease-free survival [1�5] and overall survival [1,5] of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer based on randomized clinical trials. The most important adverse effect of adjuvant trastuzumab is congestive heart failure [6]. Heart failure was detected in 0.4�3.5% of patients in the major adjuvant trastuzumab trials [7], but it may be more common than this in elderly populations [8]. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab when it is administered in combination with a capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen as compared with a regimen that does not contain capecitabine. Here we present the outcome data of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with or without adjuvant trastuzumab within the context of the Finland Capecitabine Trial (FinXX). FinXX compared safety and efficacy of an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that contained capecitabine (X), docetaxel (T), cyclophosphamide (C) and epirubicin (E, TX-CEX) to a regimen that did not contain capecitabine (T-CEF) [9]. Patients and methods Study design FinXX is a randomized, prospective, phase III, open-label, multicenter trial. The results of the comparison between the chemotherapy regimens have been published after a median follow-up time of 4.9 years, and they tended to favor TX-CEX over T-CEF with five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 86.6% and 84.1%, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.087) [9]. Patients Women who had histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with regional lymph nodes containing cancer, or node-negative cancer with primary tumor diameter > 20 mm and negative progesterone receptor (PR) expression in immunohistochemistry (usually defined as staining of < 10% of cancer cells) were eligible [10]. Other key inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years; the World Health Organization (WHO) performance status < 2; the time interval between surgery and randomization ? 12 weeks; and normal hepatic, renal and cardiac function. Patients who had distant metastases at the time of study entry were excluded, as were patients who had node-negative mucinous, papillary, medullary or tubular cancer, and those who had clinically significant cardiac disease or who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, registered (www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00114816), and the institutional review boards approved the study protocol. The patients provided written informed consent prior to study entry. A total of 1500 patients entered the study between 27 January 2004 and 29 May 2007 [9]. Two patients withdrew consent and three had overt distant metastases at staging, and were excluded from further analyses (Figure 1). Of the 1495 remaining patients 284 (19.0%) had HER2-positive disease based on immunohistochemistry (HER2 expression classified as +++) or a positive in situ hybridization test at local assessment, and form the basis of the present analysis. The reproducibility of HER2 testing is generally good in the study regions [11]. Figure 1. Enrolment of study participants. Following the release of the results of three randomized trials (HERA, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831) [12,13], the FinXX study protocol was amended in May 2005 while patient accrual was ongoing to allow treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease with adjuvant trastuzumab. At the time of the protocol amendment 619 (41.3%) of the planned 1500 patients had been entered the FinXX study. The study protocol was amended also in 27 May 2012 after publication of the study results based on a median follow-up time of 59 months in January 2012 [9] to allow collection of further survival and safety data from the subgroup with HER2-positive disease and to achieve a longer follow-up time. Study objectives RFS (the primary endpoint) was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of detection of invasive breast cancer recurrence (local or distant), or death if the patient died prior to cancer recurrence. Second cancer or contralateral breast cancer were not counted as events. The secondary endpoints were cardiac adverse events and overall survival, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Adjuvant treatments Patients were randomly assigned centrally in a 1:1 ratio to chemotherapy containing capecitabine and standard agents or to chemotherapy containing standard agents only [9]. The patients assigned to capecitabine-containing chemotherapy received three cycles of TX (T, docetaxel; X, capecitabine) followed by three cycles of CEX (C, cyclophosphamide; E, epirubicin; X, capecitabine; TX � 3 ? CEX � 3). TX consisted of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 given as a one-hour i.v. infusion on day 1 of every three-week cycle and capecitabine 900 mg/m2 given orally b.i.d. on days 1 to 15. CEX consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 administered on day 1, and oral capecitabine 900 mg/m2 given b.i.d. days 1 to 15 every three weeks [9]. Patients assigned to the control group received three cycles of docetaxel (80 mg/m2 administered as a one-hour i.v. infusion on day 1 of every three-week cycle) followed by three cycles of CEF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each week-week cycle; T � 3 ? CEF � 3). Chemotherapy was given for six cycles unless intolerable toxicity occurred or disease recurrence was detected. Chemotherapy doses were modified based on observed toxicity [9]. Since the optimal method to administer trastuzumab was unknown, the method was not specified when the protocol was amended in 2005. Of the 284 patients with HER2-positive disease entered, 108 (38.0%) did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab [99 (91.7%) of these 108 patients initiated adjuvant treatment before 27 May 2005] and 176 (62.0%) received it. Most patients with HER2-positive disease who were treated with adjuvant trastuzumab received it for 12 months [131(74.4%) of 176]. After the release of the FinHer trial results in December 2005 [3], 45 (25.6%) patients received trastuzumab for nine weeks, administered as in the FinHer trial weekly and concomitantly with docetaxel [3]. Most [n = 104 (79.4%)] patients who received trastuzumab for 12 months had all trastuzumab given after completion of chemotherapy administered as in the HERA trial [12], whereas 27 (20.6%) patients received trastuzumab first for nine weeks concomitantly with docetaxel (administered as in the FinHer trial) and subsequently three-weekly for 42 weeks after chemotherapy to complete one year of administration (a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, then a dose of 6 mg/kg three-weekly). Two patients with HER2-negative cancer received adjuvant trastuzumab, since their cancer was first misdiagnosed as HER2-positive (Figure 1). Radiation therapy was given according to the institution's practice after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with steroid hormone receptor-positive disease [estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/or PR-positive] received adjuvant endocrine therapy for five years; premenopausal patients tamoxifen 20 mg/day and postmenopausal women anastrozole 1 mg daily [9]. Recording of adverse events and follow-up Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov) [14]. Left ventricle ejection fractions (LVEF) were followed up with either echocardiography or isotope cardiography according to the institutional practice during trastuzumab administration, usually at approximately three month intervals. The LVEF results were not recorded on the study database. Study participants were scheduled to be followed up for ? 5 years after randomization [9]. Statistical analysis Efficacy analyses were done with the intention- to-treat principle. Frequency tables were analyzed with the ?2-test or Fisher's exact test. Non-normal distributions were compared with Mann-Whitney's test or Kruskal-Wallis's analysis of variance. Survival between groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier life-table method and the log-rank test, the hazard ratios were computed using an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model. The subgroup analyses were performed by including the treatment group, the subgroup variable and their interaction in the Cox model. All p-values are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were done with SAS� version 8.2 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results Patient and tumor characteristics Of the 284 patients with HER2-positive disease, 146 were assigned to TX-CEX and 138 to T-CEF. The characteristics of the patients and the tumors are provided in Table I. HER2-positive tumors were more often large, ductal, poorly differentiated and steroid hormone receptor-negative as compared with HER2-negative tumors (n = 1211), and a larger proportion of the patients with HER2-positive cancer had node-negative disease and did not receive adjuvant hormonal therapy. Except for tumor histological type, the patient and tumor characteristics were similar between the subgroups of patients with HER2-positive disease who received (n = 176) or did not receive (n = 108) adjuvant trastuzumab (each p is > 0.05, Table I).

Efficacy The median follow-up time of the 284 patients with HER2-positive disease who were alive at the time of the data lock (15 June 2012) was 6.7 years (range 0.8�8.4 years). By this date, 52 (18.3%) of the 284 patients had a RFS event and 39 (13.7%) had died. The five-year RFS of the 176 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab was 89.2% as compared with 75.9% in the subset of 108 patients who did not receive trastuzumab (log-rank p = 0.001; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23�0.72; Figure 2). Of the patients treated with trastuzumab, 92.0% were alive at five years after the date of randomization and 88.2% seven years after randomization as compared with 88.9% and 82.3% of those treated without trastuzumab, respectively (p = 0.266; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37�1.32). Figure 2. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) since the date of randomization of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Upper panel: RFS by treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab; Lower panel: RFS by the duration of adjuvant trastuzumab. The five-year survival figures are shown. Patients who were censored are indicated with a bar. Patients who were treated for 12 months with adjuvant trastuzumab (n = 131) and those treated for nine weeks concomitantly with chemotherapy (n = 45) had similar five-year RFS (89.3% and 88.9%, respectively; p = 0.976, HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.36�2.71; Figure 2). The patient and breast cancer characteristics were not statistically different between these two groups except for cancer steroid hormone receptor expression, which was less frequent in the subset treated for nine weeks with trastuzumab (Table II). Patients treated with nine weeks of trastuzumab received less often adjuvant hormonal therapy (due to a larger proportion of hormone receptor-negative tumors in this group) and post-operative radiotherapy. Overall survival did not differ between patients treated for 12 months or for nine weeks with trastuzumab (92.4% vs. 91.1% survived for five years, respectively; p = 0.996; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32�3.09).

There was no interaction between adjuvant trastuzumab and the type of chemotherapy given (p = 0.248 for RFS and 0.132 for overall survival). Patients with HER2-positive disease had better RFS when treated with trastuzumab regardless of the type of chemotherapy (T-CEF or TX-CEX, Figure 3). Figure 3. Recurrence-free survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with docetaxel (T) followed by cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil (CEF) or with docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) followed by cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and capecitabine (CEX) with or without trastuzumab. Since patients with HER2-positive disease had improved RFS after the year 2005, we estimated whether other factors than trastuzumab might have contributed to the improved RFS by comparing the outcome of the 1211 patients with HER2-negative cancer entered to the trial before and after 27 May 2005, whose study treatments remained unaltered throughout the trial accrual period. Patients with HER2-negative cancer who were randomized before or on 27 May 2005 (n = 493) turned out to have similar RFS as those randomized after 27 May 2005 (five-year RFS 85.0% vs. 86.3%, respectively; p = 0.857; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72�1.31), and their overall survival was also similar (five-year survival 90.9% vs. 92.1%, respectively; p = 0.828; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71�1.54). Patients with HER2-positive cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab tended to have better RFS than women who had HER2-negative breast cancer (five-year RFS 89.2% vs. 85.8%; p = 0.084; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42�1.06), whereas patients with HER2-negative disease had more favorable RFS compared to the women who had HER2-positive breast cancer and did not receive trastuzumab (five-year RFS 85.8% vs. 75.9%; p = 0.007; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39�0.88). Cardiac events Six (2.1%) of the 284 patients with HER2-positive cancer and four (2.3%) of the 176 patients treated with trastuzumab were diagnosed with cardiac insufficiency or left ventricular dysfunction during the follow-up. All of these four patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab had left ventricular dysfunction diagnosed within 13 months from the date of initiation of trastuzumab. Three of the four patients received trastuzumab for 12 months and one for nine weeks, and three were assigned to receive capecitabine. None of the patients treated with trastuzumab was diagnosed with myocardial infarction during the follow-up. The adverse effects related to the chemotherapy regimens have been reported earlier [9,14]. Discussion We found in this preplanned exploratory analysis of the FinXX trial that patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who were treated with trastuzumab had better RFS than those who did not receive trastuzumab. Adjuvant trastuzumab was not administered based on random allocation in the FinXX trial. However, except for allowing adjuvant trastuzumab in the amended study protocol in 2005, the study treatments were otherwise kept unaltered, the participating study centers remained the same throughout the study, and the data are not confounded by cross-over or administration of adjuvant trastuzumab after the protocol-defined treatments had been completed. These factors generated an opportunity to investigate the effects of adjuvant trastuzumab on outcome in the setting of the FinXX trial. The substantial improvement in RFS observed is likely due to trastuzumab administration, since there was little difference in the characteristics of the patients or the cancers treated with or without trastuzumab, and RFS of patients with HER2-negative disease who entered the study before or after amending the study protocol in May 2005 did not change with time. The current results thus provide further evidence that adjuvant trastuzumab improves RFS of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. There was no significant interaction between administration of adjuvant trastuzumab and the type of chemotherapy, and trastuzumab improved RFS significantly in the subset of patients treated with TX-CEX. Although capecitabine is being used extensively in the treatment of advanced breast cancer [15], we are unaware of any other study that has addressed the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine. It is currently controversial whether integration of capecitabine into standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens improves outcome, and several studies addressing adjuvant capecitabine are ongoing [www.ClinicalTrials.gov]. In the U.S. Oncology Group randomized trial USON01062, where 2611 women were assigned to receive first four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by either four cycles of docetaxel or four cycles of TX, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (disease-free survival) between the two arms, but women treated with TX had significantly better overall survival [16]. A joint analysis of the FinXX and the USON01062 trials found addition of capecitabine to a taxane-anthracycline regimen to improve significantly disease-free survival, overall survival and to reduce death from breast cancer [17], whereas a randomized single-center trial that compared weekly paclitaxel with TX as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatments of early breast cancer was interrupted early due to absence of benefit associated with TX [18]. The influence of adjuvant trastuzumab on overall survival was inconclusive. The HR of 0.68 for overall survival favored trastuzumab and is of similar magnitude as those reported from randomized adjuvant trials [1�4]. Yet, as in some randomized trials addressing adjuvant trastuzumab [2,3,19], the analysis of overall survival was not statistically significant. This might be due to the limited numbers of deaths encountered, cross-over between arms [2] or the treatments given for advanced breast cancer, which may influence the overall survival rates [20,21]. Although the standard duration of adjuvant trastuzumab administration is currently 12 months, the optimal duration remains unknown. The recent findings from the HERA trial suggest that two years of trastuzumab administration may be regarded as inferior to one year of administration, since two years of trastuzumab does not improve survival but results in more cardiac toxicity [22] and requires more healthcare resources [23,24]. Results from the PHARE trial that compares six versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab remained inconclusive after a relatively short median follow-up time of 3.5 years [25]. The present results on nine-week administration of trastuzumab concomitantly with docetaxel provide support for continuation of the ongoing randomized adjuvant trials that evaluate short durations of trastuzumab, since we found no difference in RFS or survival between the subsets of patients who received trastuzumab for nine weeks or for 12 months. The characteristics of the patients and tumors were similar in the groups except for presence of more hormone receptor-negative cancers in the 9-week group. This difference, which likely occurred by chance, is unlikely to favor the 9-week group [26]. This observation should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients who were treated with 9-week duration of trastuzumab (n = 45), the retrospective and exploratory nature of the analysis, and administration of single-agent trastuzumab after completion of chemotherapy to most patients in the 12-month group, which is probably less effective as compared with concomitant administration [4]. The results indicate that women diagnosed with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with trastuzumab generally have favorable outcome. The seven-year RFS was as high as 89.2% despite we included only patients with a moderate or high risk of breast cancer recurrence in the FinXX trial. Of note, RFS of these women tended to be even better than that of the patients with HER2-negative disease. The study accrued a large number of patients from a relatively small population and a short time period, which may reduce the risk of a major selection bias. In conclusion, the observations from this planned exploratory analysis of a randomized FinXX trial suggest that adjuvant trastuzumab improves RFS of patients treated with adjuvant T-CEF or TX-CEX chemotherapy, and that trastuzumab is safe and effective when administered to patients who receive an adjuvant regimen that contains capecitabine integrated with standard agents, such as TX-CEX. The findings support continuation of the testing of regimens where trastuzumab is administered concomitantly with chemotherapy for a short time period in controlled randomized trials. RFS of patients with moderate- or high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab has turned favorable, and may now be better than that of patients with moderate- or high-risk HER2-negative breast cancer.

Introduction Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are commonly isolated from the blood by targeting the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) through positive selection. However, EpCAM can be downregulated during metastatic progression, or it can be initially not present. We designed the present prospective trial to characterize CTCs as well as other circulating cell populations in blood samples from women with metastatic breast cancer without EpCAM-dependent enrichment and/or isolation technology. Methods A total of 32 patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled, and blood samples were processed using a previously described negative depletion immunomagnetic methodology. Samples from healthy volunteers were run as controls (n?=?5). Multistep sequential labeling was performed to label and fix cell-surface markers followed by permeabilization for cytokeratins (CK) 8, 18 and 19. Multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) analysis was conducted using a BD LSR II flow cytometer or a BD FACSAria II or FACSAria III cell sorter. Immunocytochemical staining on postenrichment specimens for DAPI, EpCAM, CD45, CK, epidermal growth factor receptor and vimentin was performed. Expression of these markers was visualized using confocal microscopy (CM). Results CD45-negative/CK-positive (CD45? CK+) populations with EpCAM?+?and EpCAM???expression were identified with both FCM and CM from the negatively enriched patient samples. In addition, EpCAM?+?and EpCAM???populations that were CK?+?and coexpressing the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 were also noted. There were more CK?+?EpCAM???events/ml than CK?+?EpCAM?+?events/ml in both the CD45? and CD45+ fractions (both statistically significant at P???0.0005). The number of CK?+?CD45? and CK?+?CD45+ events per milliliter in blood samples (regardless of EpCAM status) was higher in patient samples than in normal control samples (P???0.0005 and P???0.026, respectively). Further, a significant fraction of the CK?+?CD45+ events also expressed CD68, a marker associated with tumor-associated macrophages. Higher levels of CD45-CK?+?EpCAM???were associated with worse overall survival (P?=?0.0292). Conclusions Metastatic breast cancer patients have atypical cells that are CK?+?EpCAM???circulating in their blood. Because a substantial number of these patients do not have EpCAM?+?CTCs, additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of EpCAM???circulating cells as a prognostic and predictive marker. Introduction A recently held multidisciplinary workshop titled �Lorentz Workshop Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Isolation and Diagnostics: Toward Routine Clinical Use� defined a CTC as a cell in the blood originating from either a primary or metastatic tumor and having properties that enable migration into the circulation [1]. It was also mentioned that a small subset of these CTCs may establish metastatic growth after seeding in a tissue niche, with some of them having undergone an epithelial�mesenchymal transition (EMT), in order to acquire the necessary mobility and invasiveness to promote metastasis [2]. Historically, the assumption that the CTC originated from an epithelial solid tumor facilitated isolation and identification technologies that would select for surface markers consistent with epithelial cells, such as the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) [3-6]. Beyond expressing EpCAM, the accepted definition of CTC requires that cells have the following (as determined by a trained operator): nuclei; cytokeratins (CKs) CK8, CK18 and CK19; no expression of the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45; and morphology consistent with a tumor cell. Based on these criteria, an elevated number of CTCs before treatment or after one cycle of treatment is an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic breast cancer [3-7]. Researchers in two phase III trials (SWOG-S0500, Southwest Oncology Group/National Cancer Institute, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT0032018 (USA); CirCe01, Institut Curie, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01349842 (France)) currently underway are evaluating the use of EpCAM?+?CTCs as predictive markers of response to systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer [8]. A significant challenge in using CTCs as a predictive marker is that more than one-third of patients with metastatic disease do not have detectable CTCs by EpCAM-based technology [9]. Patients with undetectable CTCs have a more favorable prognosis than patients with detectable CTCs. However, there may be individual patients with poor prognoses who have CTCs not captured by EpCAM-based positive enrichment, such as patients who have undergone EMT with downregulation of EpCAM and other epithelial markers. CTCs with an EMT-like phenotype have been reported recently by several groups [10-14]. In order to avoid the potential bias associated with positive selection methods, we have developed a negative enrichment strategy that relies on red blood cell (RBC) lysis followed by a combination of well-defined viscous flow and optimized magnetic forces to remove CD45-expressing leukocytes from patients� whole-blood samples [15-17]. Using this enrichment system, we have identified CTCs in all breast cancer stages [12]. In studies conducted in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, we have shown significantly reduced disease-free survival with the presence of increased �putative� CTCs [11]. The term putative is used because EpCAM selection was not employed and, for those cells tested, EpCAM was not present. Furthermore, many CTCs expressed vimentin as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), "
Breast_Cancer "which is consistent with cells with a mesenchymal phenotype [10,18]. We hypothesized that (1) we could detect more CTCs and other atypical circulating cells if we used a non-EpCAM-based negative enrichment approach and (2) using flow cytometry (FCM) and confocal immunocytochemistry (ICC) after negative depletion would allow these putative CTCs to be phenotyped, further assisting in the classification. To test this hypothesis, peripheral blood samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer were obtained, subjected to the negative depletion process and examined by multiparametric FCM and ICC analysis to characterize the different subpopulations of EpCAM?+?and EpCAM???cells. Methods Cell cultures The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (HTB-22) and MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26) were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and grown to mid-log phase in ATCC-specified culture media at 37�C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere when specified. Cells were harvested by washing the adherent cells with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubating them with Accutase (AT104; Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA) for 5 minutes at 37�C to remove the attached cells from the culture flask. Accutase was then neutralized with the culture media before the cells were pelleted at 350?�?g for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in appropriate medium, depending on the downstream application. Patient samples and blood collection Thirty-two metastatic breast cancer patients, who were older than 18 years of age and had two or less prior lines of systemic therapy were enrolled in The Ohio State University Cancer Institutional Review Board (IRB)�approved protocol. All patients gave their informed consent to participate in the study. Blood samples were collected after several standard blood tubes were drawn for routine chemotherapy laboratory prior to initiation of a new line of systemic therapy. Peripheral blood (7.8 to 17.7 ml) was collected in BD Vacutainer tubes (366643; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for CTC enumeration and processed within 4 hours of blood collection. Normal control blood collection Blood was collected from healthy volunteer donors (n?=?5) after obtaining their informed consent using an IRB-approved protocol at The Ohio State University (OSU) Medical Center and processed in the same manner as the patient samples. In addition, 11 to 18 ml of peripheral blood was collected from ten individuals without a known diagnosis of breast cancer before they underwent diagnostic procedures at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Comprehensive Breast Care Center. Their blood samples were utilized for ICC as confocal control specimens but not were used for FCM. The protocol was approved by the Cancer Institutional Review Board of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (IRBnet 354344), initiated in January 2011, and informed, written consent was obtained from all healthy volunteer donors. Peripheral venous blood was collected in BD Vacutainer tubes (362753; BD Biosciences) and shipped overnight to OSU for immediate processing. All samples were processed within 30 hours of blood draw. Sample processing for negative depletion enrichment Blood samples were kept at ambient temperature and processed using a negative depletion immunomagnetic methodology described previously [15,16,18]. Briefly, blood samples were subjected to a RBC lysis step and labeled with anti-CD45 tetrameric antibody complex (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Magnetic nanoparticles were added and incubated with the cell suspension, which was run through the quadrupole magnetic sorter system (Figure 1). A measure of the effectiveness of the enrichment of the samples is represented as the log10 of the ratio of the total number of nucleated cells before processing to the total number of nucleated cells after processing [15,19]. Figure 1 Enrichment and analysis methodology used in this study. Multiparameter flow cytometry Sample aliquots were taken prior to and after magnetic labeling for setting up gating controls for multiparametric FCM. The enriched sample after separation was split into two fractions. One fraction was stained using a multistep sequential labeling protocol for FCM. Briefly, the FCM sample was labeled for surface markers, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde to stabilize the surface staining, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained for intracellular proteins. The antibody fluorescent probe combination used can be found in Additional file 1: Table S1. A BD LSR II flow cytometer or a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with three excitation lasers (405 nm, 488 nm and 633 nm) was used for initial FCM analysis. Both automatic and manual compensation were evaluated for each patient sample. During the study period, a BD FACSAria III cell sorter was acquired. The FACSAria III is equipped with 355-, 488-, 561- and 635-nm lasers, which allows for fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin dyes to be excited with different lasers (488 nm and 561 nm) incident to the cell at different locations in the stream, thereby significantly reducing the need for compensation. To determine whether the exclusion of nonviable cells, determined with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (L34957; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), would change the staining distribution of cells, selected patient samples for this assay were assessed using the FACSAria III system. All gates were determined on the basis of unstained and single-color controls of each patient sample, control samples from healthy volunteers or buffy coats. Because at most two colors were excited by a single laser (one dye per laser on the FACSAria III), this gating strategy was equivalent to the fluorescence minus one approach. For the samples using the viability assay, the initial step included using a side scatter width setting to exclude obvious doublets. Confocal immunocytochemistry analysis of negatively enriched patient samples After negative depletion, an aliquot of cell suspension preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin was retained for ICC staining and confocal microscopy (CM) analysis. The antibody-fluorescent probe combination used can be found in the Additional file 2: Supplemental Information. To facilitate high-quality image acquisition, an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Imaging America, Center Valley, PA, USA) equipped with 405-nm, 488-nm, 543-nm and 633-nm lasers was used. All images were acquired, and processed, using the Olympus FluoView Ver3.0 software (Olympus America), which records all relevant instrument settings and automatically determines pixel size (size scales in the x, y and z directions). Additional file 2: Supplemental Information contains images that indicate the excitation filters or laser used, the emission filters used and the excitation and emission spectra of the dyes. Statistical analysis Negatively enriched specimens were further classified into subpopulations according to the expression levels of CD45, CK and EpCAM, as visualized by FCM. CK?+?events per milliliter of blood sample volume in each subpopulation were summarized. One sample sign test was used to compare the differences between any two subpopulations from patient samples. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann�Whitney U tests) was used to test the differences between patient and healthy volunteer control groups. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm the conclusions using a paired t-test (two-sample t-test with unequal variance after proper data transformation). The P-values without multiple comparison adjustment are reported. Kaplan�Meier plots Kaplan�Meier (KM analysis) was performed on several of the subpopulations identified by multiparametric FCM. Given the distinct grouping of cohorts required for the KM estimator, we chose to use binary grouping: patients with number of events per milliliter of blood sample of the specific combination of markers below a cutoff and above the cutoff. This cutoff was initially set at one standard deviation above the mean of normal blood controls, which works well when the specific cell population is not rare. However, as is generally recognized, the detection and analysis of rare events (approximately 0.1% and less), such as CTCs in peripheral blood specimens by FCM, is challenging. Authors of several experimental and theoretical reports have attempted to provide a statistically based approach to reliably enumerate rare events by FCM. One such approach is the use of Poisson distribution statistics, which deal with the probability distribution of rare events. A Poisson coefficient of variation (CV) associated with rare event data obtained in a flow cytometer can be estimated by the following equation: (1) CV = 100 r where, r is the number of events detected [20-23]. Equation (1) indicates that a CV of 10% requires 100 events to be positively detected and that a CV of 5% requires 400 events. The smallest blood sample we obtained in this study was approximately 4 ml. To achieve a CV of 5%, 400 positive events needed to be detected. Therefore, in this study, to be able to associate a CV of 5% to a measurement, at least 100 events/ml of blood sample volume were needed. Consequently, when the mean plus one standard deviation of the normal controls was less than 100 events/ml of blood sample volume, we set 100 events/ml of blood sample volume as a cutoff. When the mean plus standard deviation of the normal controls was greater than 100, we set this value as the cutoff. Results Clinical characteristics Thirty-two patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled, including fifteen triple-negative (TNBC) estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 (ER???PR?? Her2?), fourteen ER?+?Her2? and three Her2+ patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 35 to 75 years). All patients had visceral involvement in one or more sites. The patients� clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Immunomagnetic negative depletion of patient samples Nucleated cell counts were determined prior to the RBC lysis step, after RBC lysis and after magnetic depletion of CD45?+?-labeled cells. The average recovery of nucleated cells after RBC lysis was 58%, the average nucleated log10 depletion was 2.7 and the total log10 depletion was 5.6 (range, 4.0 to 6.2). (A log10 depletion of 6.0 corresponds to only one of one million cells left after processing). Flow cytometry analysis of negatively enriched blood Blood samples were analyzed by FCM after enrichment. Data from spiking studies of cell lines as well as isotype control studies are shown in Additional file 2: Supplemental Data. Figure 2a illustrates the CD45 gating strategy for negative enriched control (healthy volunteer), and Figure 2b shows the analysis of a representative sample from a patient with metastatic breast cancer. Four different CK?+?subpopulations were identified by FCM using the antibody conjugates targeting CD45, CK and EpCAM. Selected samples obtained using the FACSAria III were also stained with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (n?=?5). No significant difference in the ratio of the four different subfractions was observed when dead cells were excluded compared to when they were not excluded (data not shown). Figure 2 Comparative flow cytometry analyses. (a) CD45-depleted, buffy coat blood sample. (b) Representative triple-negative breast cancer patient blood sample.

In part (b), a third row of plots is presented in which the events in the red outlined quadrant in the second row are further investigated with respect to SS verses CD68 expression. APC, Allophycocyanin; Cy7, Cyanine 7; FITC, Fluorescein isothiocyanate; FMO, Fluorescence minus one; PE, Phycoerythrin; PerCP, Peridinin chlorophyll protein. As shown in Figure 2b, and consistent with all of the CD45?+?CK?+?cells observed in all of the FCM analyses, the vast majority of the cells weakly expressed CD45 (within an order of magnitude of signal intensity used to �gate� between positive and negative cells) and appeared in the side scatter and forward scatter plots in the region consistent with more granulocyte-type cells. This observation is in contrast to more typically �bright� CD45 cells, which demonstrate less granulocytic characteristics and are presumably more lymphocyte-like and are removed in the magnetic depletion step. Additional characterization of the CD45?+?CK?+?events in flow cytometry analysis To begin to further characterize this CD45?+?CK?+?subpopulation, we added an anti-CD68 antibody added to the staining protocol for 11 patient samples. For the samples tested, more than 90% of the CD45?+?CK?+?events were CD68-positive. One representative sample is presented in the bottom row of Figure 2b. Each dot plot in the bottom row corresponds to the specific quadrants in the middle row highlighted in red. The CD45?+?CK?+ EPCAM???population (middle row, center dot plot and red-highlighted quadrant) is clearly positive for CD68. The location of CD68+ cells on the side scatter axis is consistent with the location of larger granular cells, such as monocyte- and/or macrophage-like cells. Although there are other weakly positive CD68 populations in the two other dot plots in the third row, the strongest CD68 positivity is present only in the CD45?+?CK?+ EpCAM???population. Distinct subpopulations of atypical cells are present in metastatic breast cancer Plots of the different subpopulations of the enriched patient samples in terms of the number of events per milliliter of blood sample volume, as identified by FCM, are presented in Figure 3 (number of CD45? and CD45+ events per milliliter of blood sample volume). For comparison, the same subpopulations are also presented for the healthy donors. As shown in Table 2, the CD45?+ CK?+?EpCAM?, CD45?+?CK?+?EpCAM+, CD45???CK?+ EpCAM???and CD45???CK?+?EpCAM?+?events per milliliter of blood sample volume in patient samples were all significantly higher than those in healthy control samples (P?=?0.03, P?=?0.0007, P?=?0.0004 and P?=?0.0008, respectively). The numbers of CK?+?CD45? and CK?+?CD45+ events per milliliter of blood sample volume, regardless of EpCAM status, were also significantly higher in patient samples than in control samples (P???0.0005 and P???0.026, respectively). Consistent with the generally accepted concept that the concentration of the traditionally defined CTCs is not high enough to be routinely detected in FCM analysis without sampling large blood volumes (that is, greater than 20 ml), the CD45???CK?+?EpCAM?+?population concentrations were significantly greater than the control; however, most of the concentrations were below the 100 events per milliliter of blood sample volume threshold, which corresponded to a CV of 5% (black solid lines in Figure 3). The only subpopulation where the mean plus one standard deviation of events in the controls was greater than 100 events per milliliter of blood sample volume was CD45?+?CK?+?EpCAM?. Consequently, for this subpopulation, the threshold was set as the mean plus one standard deviation of the controls for that subpopulation (1,000 events per milliliter of blood sample volume). Figure 3 Scatterplots of the estimated number of cytokeratin-positive events per milliliter of blood sample volume as determined by flow cytometry. The solid black lines correspond to a Poisson distribution coefficient of variation of 5%. Note that two normal donor specimens have more than 100 CD45?+?CK?+?EpCAM???events per milliliter of blood sample volume.

The values in each cell are medians (25% to 75% quartile range). P-values were calculated using the Mann�Whitney U tests of the subpopulations between control and patient samples. Additional comparisons of the subpopulations present in patient samples highlights that there were significantly more CK?+?EpCAM???events than CK?+?EpCAM?+?events in both CD45? and CD45+ fractions (both P?<?0.0005). There were no significant differences among the breast cancer subtypes (Figure 3). Clinical outcome correlations Combining all three types of metastatic breast cancer, we asked whether elevated concentrations of these various subtypes would be predictive of progression-free survival or overall survival (OS) as determined by KM estimator analysis. As a binary cutoff for the KM analysis, we used the criteria for elevation that the concentration of events per milliliter of blood sample volume should have a CV of at least 5% and 100 or more events per milliliter of blood sample volume for the CD45???CK?+?EpCAM?? population. For the CD45?+?CK?+?EpCAM???population, we used the mean plus one standard deviation of the normal patient population as a cutoff. These four KM plots are presented in Figure 4. Total events of 100 or more per milliliter of blood sample volume were associated with significantly poorer OS (P?=?0.029).

Confirmation of flow cytometry�defined subpopulations using immunocytochemistry confocal microscopy To provide independent visual confirmation of the CD45? and CD45+ subtypes characterized by FCM analysis, four-color epifluorescence and confocal analysis of cytospins from among several of the enriched metastatic samples was conducted. Figures 5a and 5b show various combinations of the antibody fluoroprobes used in this study, confirming the specificity of Alexa Fluor custom-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) to two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Note that MCF-7 is positive for all except CD45 and vimentin and MDA-MB-231 is negative for CK8, CK18 and CK19 but positive for at least one of CK1, CK4, CK5, CK6, CK10 or CK13 using a pan-CK antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

The bottom two rows of images show healthy donor PBMCs and MDA-MB-231 stained with the same antibody dye conjugates and the CK antibody replaced by pan-CK versions. (b) Confocal immunofluorescent images show healthy donor PBMCs, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 stained with DAPI (blue); anti-CK7, anti-CK8, anti-CK18 and anti-CK19 antibody (green); antivimentin (red); and anti�epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; white). Figure 6a presents low-magnification and high-magnification confocal images of a representative patient (whose FCM data are presented in Figure 2b) confirming the presence of various positive and negative combinations of CK and EpCAM staining on both CD45? and CD45+ subpopulations visualized by FCM. Colored arrows are used in Figure 6 to facilitate identification of several of the subtypes of interest in this study. It should be noted that it is very rare to find a DAPI?+?CD45?+?CK-EpCAM???cell in these enriched samples, given the average log10 value of 2.7 for depletion of nucleated cells. Additional file 2: Supplemental Information provides low-magnification epifluorescent images of a patient sample prior to and after magnetic depletion. Figure 6 Examples of different cell types found in the peripheral blood of triple-negative breast cancer patients. (a) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of representative triple-negative breast cancer patients shown in low- and high-magnification confocal microscopy immunofluorescent images stained with cytokeratin (CK) antibody (green), CD45 antibody (red), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (white) and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). To assist in the identification of different cell types, based on staining pattern, we added arrows of different color according to the key provided. (b) High-magnification confocal images from a patient peripheral blood sample highlighting the different staining combinations observed. Figure 6b presents high-magnification representative confocal images of expression of a traditional CTC (row 1), a putative CTC that is EpCAM???(row 2), a cell with absent CKs (CK8, CK18 and CK19) but EpCAM?+?(row 3), an atypical cell that is EpCAM?+?but absent CKs (CK8, CK18 and CK19) and series of CD45?+?CK?+?cells that were recorded in almost all of the FCM analyses (rows 4 and 5). Multiparametric immunocytochemistry with vimentin and epidermal growth factor receptor staining The FCM analysis and the confocal images indicate that other rare cells that do not fit the traditional definition of CTCs were present (that is, CD45???CK?+?EpCAM?). To further phenotypically characterize these cells, different staining protocols were used, including replacing EpCAM and/or CD45 with vimentin or EGFR. Figure 7 presents a cytospin of enriched TNBC patient blood stained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), CD45, CK and vimentin replacing EpCAM. Row 1 shows a traditional CTC negative for vimentin. Rows 2 and 3 show CD45? cells that have both epithelial (CK) and mesenchymal (vimentin) marker expression. Figure 8 presents further analysis in which EGFR replaces the CD45 staining. The four rows represent the four different staining combinations observed in the same cytospin of the blood sample from the same patient, again demonstrating subpopulation heterogeneity in metastatic patients. It should also be noted that CD45 was used in the examples presented in Figure 7 and that all of the vimentin-positive cells are CD45? and therefore not traditionally defined hematopoietic cells. In Figure 8, though CD45 was not used, the vimentin-positive cells are positive for either EGFR or cytokeratins, further decreasing the probability that these cells are of hematopoietic origin as sometimes suggested. Figure 7 Confocal immunofluorescent images of four representative triple-negative breast cancer patients. Images are stained with cytokeratin (CK) antibody (green), CD45 antibody (red), vimentin (white) and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). Note that the vimentin-positive cells are negative for the hematopoietic marker CD45. DIC, Differential interference contrast images; EGFR, Epidermal growth factor receptor. Figure 8 Further combination of confocal images. Images were produced by cytospin of a triple-negative breast cancer blood sample stained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); antibodies against cytokeratins CK7, CK8, CK18 and CK19; anti-vimentin; and anti�epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The four rows represent the four different combinations observed in the blood sample from this patient. Discussion The currently accepted definition of a CTC is a nucleated cell that is positive for epithelial marker expression of EpCAM and cytokeratins CK8, CK18 and CK19 and negative for the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45. "
Breast_Cancer " In addition to identifying these traditional CTCs, we show herein that there are other abnormal circulating cell populations present in blood samples from metastatic breast cancer patients. These populations include EpCAM???cells that are CK+, cells that express mesenchymal markers but few or no epithelial markers and cells which express both hematopoietic and epithelial makers. These findings highlight the fact that blood from metastatic breast cancer patients has a heterogeneous mixture of abnormal cells and is consistent with other reports of heterogeneous mixtures of putative CTCs [4,13,14,24]. Multiple studies have shown that CTCs detected by EpCAM?+?selection are prognostic in metastatic breast cancer [3,9,25-29]. Current ongoing studies are evaluating how and if these classical CTCs can be utilized as predictive markers in treatment decision-making [8]. However, on average, only up to 65% of patients with metastatic breast cancer have identifiable CTCs that fit these criteria [3,9]. There is wide speculation regarding why patients with metastatic breast cancer may have undetectable CTCs. As a group, patients with undetectable CTCs may have a better prognosis, but the lack of circulating biomarkers still can make evaluation of targeted therapies challenging. Additionally, it is possible that some tumors with aggressive features may have undergone EMT, which would downregulate epithelial markers such as EpCAM. Further, the molecularly classified basal-like breast tumors have a low or nonexistent expression of EpCAM and have increased expression of mesenchymal markers [30]. Studies utilizing cell lines have established the limitation of EpCAM?+?selection in recovering basal-like tumor cell lines [31], although no definitive study has clearly illustrated that this type of enrichment is not successful in basaloid tumors. Moreover, several studies have shown the EpCAM?+?selection is still a reliable prognostic marker in patients with metastatic TNBC [32-35]. However, the question remains whether there are additional cell populations of interest that could be missed using EpCAM preselection in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Konigsberg et al. compared two CTC isolation methods: an immunomagnetic positive selection approach targeting EpCAM (MACS CD326 (human epithelial antigen) MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) and an antibody-independent, density gradient centrifugation device which assumes CTCs have distinct, different densities compared to normal blood components (OncoQuick Plus; Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) [36]. Their spiking studies confirmed the limitations of relying on a positive selection targeting EpCAM to identify all atypical cell populations within a given sample across a heterogeneous disease, consistent with other cell line studies [31]. However, it should be noted that their study included only CK markers and did not further characterize these cells. In addition, studies demonstrating the clinical utility of OncoQuick Plus isolated CTCs are limited. The clinical significance of EpCAM???CTC is not clear. Most recently, EpCAM???CTCs isolated by FCM and having a Notch1+/EGFR+/Her2+/EpCAM???phenotype resulted in established cells lines and also demonstrated a high-level invasive capability in the brains and lungs of nude mice [37]. The removal of the requirement that a CTC must express EpCAM but still be CD45? significantly increases the number of potential cells that can be called CTCs. This phenomenon is clearly seen in the dot plot of the CD45? EpCAM versus CK data for one of the patients (Figure 2b, second row, first plot). In that plot, though there are a few events in the EpCAM?+?CK?+?quadrant a much larger number of cells are present in the EpCAM?? CK?+?quadrant. These EpCAM???CK?+?cell concentrations are higher in the patient samples than in those of the healthy donors (Table 2) and are associated with worse OS based on our preliminary results (Figure 4). Most striking is that in this feasibility study, with a limited number of patients, elevated levels of EpCAM???CK?+?CD45? cells correlated with poor OS, not just in TNBC patients but also in ER?+?patients. A larger pool of candidate atypical circulating cells would expand the possibility of further molecular profiling and analysis of targeted therapies. Currently, narrowly defined, traditional CTC populations can be very low in a large number of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The confocal images presented herein confirm the heterogeneity of the populations observed in the FCM analysis with respect to CK, CD45 and EpCAM expression, including the classically defined CTC (CD45???CK?+ EpCAM+), as well as of other atypical populations, including CD45???CK?+?EpCAM???and CD45???CK???EpCAM+. The size of many of these cells is similar to the size of typical white blood cells. Although it would be highly desirable to obtain estimates of the number of these different subtypes per milliliter of patient blood sample volume, such counting using a confocal microscope is not practical. It is possible to obtain cell counts using a fluorescence microscope, this technology does not have the ability to reliably distinguish between positive and negative signals at the higher wavelengths. The CM analysis also demonstrates the presence of cells that express vimentin and EGFR, possibly suggesting that these cells have undergone EMT associated with the basal subtype. Our study findings raise several questions. Do EpCAM?? CK?+?cells correspond to a subpopulation of CTCs with more aggressive features? These EpCAM cells with low expression are of interest because they can express mesenchymal markers such as EGFR and vimentin, biomarkers that are associated with EMT. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, CK?+?cells that were positive for vimentin and or EGFR were identified by ICC and FCM, and we found similar rare cells with mesenchymal markers in the blood of patients with head and neck malignancies [10]. In addition, other unusual cells were identified, including those that were negative for CD45, EpCAM and cytokeratins CK8, CK18 and CK19 but positive for vimentin, which is suggestive of the presence of an EMT phenotype. Vimentin can be present in normal blood cells. However, in all of our previous studies and the present study, we have not observed any cells that stained positive with both CD45 and vimentin, as shown in Figure 5b. Further, we have not observed any vimentin-positive cells in the blood of our healthy volunteer controls. When we visualized vimentin-positive patient samples, as shown in Figures 7 and 8, we found that the cells were either CD45? negative or positive for several other markers not associated with normal blood (CK and EGFR). These rare cell populations would not have been identified by utilizing a positive selection methodology initially targeting EpCAM. In addition to EpCAM?+?and EpCAM???cell populations, herein we show that there are other abnormal circulating cell types, including the perplexing population of cells that expresses both CD45 and CK. This population has been noted by others but has not been described in detail and is believed to be primarily an artefact [1,24]. Given the limitations of the enrichment strategy, isolation technology, ICC using fluorescent dyes and the belief that the cells are artefacts, these cells have rarely been isolated and characterized. The significant number of CD45?+?CK?+?cells in all patient samples raises the question whether these are analysis artefacts, such as cell doublets or cells having nonspecific binding of the anti-CK antibody or the anti-CD45 antibody. In patient samples in which we used the viability dye and side scatter width settings, which is reported to exclude dead cells and obvious doublets during FCM analysis, we still observed CD45?+?CK?+?cells. In fact, the addition of these FCM selection criteria did not significantly lower the number of CD45?+?CK?+?events. These data, along with multiparametric confocal images, suggest that there is a population of atypical cells that have both hematopoietic and epithelial-like characteristics that merit further investigation. Although the staining of CD68 began late in our present study, we observed these CD68 subpopulations in multiple independent patient samples. Further, this specific combination of staining is not observed in normal patient samples. Although we acknowledge that nonspecific binding is a possible explanation for this population, the positive CD68 expression is consistently present in higher levels in metastatic patients and there is a trend toward increased levels at the time of progression. Recent reports have highlighted that increased tumor-associated macrophages in primary breast tumors are associated with worse outcomes and chemotherapy resistance [38]. However, concurrent changes in the blood have not been reported yet. Additional studies aimed at multiparametric characterization of this population, including CD16, CD14 and colony-stimulating factor receptor type 1 staining, are underway. This study has several limitations, including a limited sample size and lack of a test and validation set to confirm correlations with clinical outcomes. However, this pilot study highlights the importance of the unbiased characterization of the atypical circulating cells that are present in metastatic breast cancer patients and that the traditional CTCs make up a minority of the abnormal circulating cells in blood samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the presence of circulating, nucleated EpCAM?+ CK?+?and EpCAM???CK?+?in the blood samples of a series comprising only metastatic breast cancer patients, as demonstrated by multiparametric FCM concurrently with ICC. Characterization of these subpopulations through advancements in multiparametric spectral analysis and molecular marker analysis may further elucidate the nature of these cells. Additional studies are needed to discern which of these subpopulations are most clinically relevant, although our preliminary results suggest that the CK?+?EpCAM???population is of interest.

Breast_Cancer "Purpose Young women who have been identified as carrying a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face a unique set of challenges related to managing cancer risk during a demographically-dense stage of life. They may struggle with decision-making in the absence of clear age-specific guidelines for medical management and because they have not yet fully developed the capacity to make life-altering decisions confidently. This study sought a patient-centered perspective on the dilemmas faced by 18�24 year olds who completed BRCA1/2 gene mutation testing prior to their 25th birthdays. Patients and Method This study integrated qualitative data from three independent investigations of BRCA1/2-positive women recruited through cancer risk clinics, hospital-based research centers, and online organizations. All 32 participants were women aged 21�25 who tested positive for a BRCA1/2 gene mutation between 2 and 60 months prior to data collection. Investigators used techniques of grounded theory and interpretive description to conduct both within and cross-study analysis. Results Participants expressed needs for (1) greater clarity in recommendations for screening and prevention before age 25, especially with consideration of early and regular exposure to radiation associated with mammography or to hormones used in birth control, and (2) ongoing contact with providers to discuss risk management protocols as they become available. Conclusions Health care needs during the young adult years evolve with the cognitive capacity to address abrupt and pressing change. Specific needs of women in this population include a desire to balance autonomous decision-making with supportive guidance, a need for clear, accurate and consistent medical recommendations. Optimally, these women are best cared for by a team of genetically-oriented providers as part of a sustained program of ongoing support, rather than seen in an episodic, crisis-driven fashion. A discussion of insurance issues and provider-patient cultural differences is presented. This study was funded through the intramural program of the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Genetics and Epidemiology, Clinical Genetics Branch. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Introduction Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk for women aged 18�24 Deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes increase a woman's lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. By age 70, approximately 60�70% and 45�55% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers will develop breast cancer, respectively; 40% and 20% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers will develop ovarian cancer [1]. By age 30, however, these risks are 3.4% and 1.5% for breast cancer, and 1�2% for ovarian cancer [2]�[4]. While these risks are high in relative terms (i.e., compared with age-matched women from the general population), they may be viewed quite differently if presented in absolute terms (e.g., by age 30, 95% will not develop breast or ovarian cancer). BRCA1/2 mutation testing may be offered once a woman reaches age 18 [5]. However, independent decision-making is often not well-established by this time in life [6]. Evidence-based approaches to management widely-used for older mutation carriers have not been developed (see Table 1), nor have clinical trials been undertaken for mutation-carriers <25 [7]. Women aged 18�24 who pursue BRCA1/2 mutation testing may receive highly personal and emotionally-charged cancer risk information before they are able to confidently manage this risk. The typical primary care provider is often not equipped to bring a balanced, authoritative perspective to the extraordinary concerns faced by these women. Consequently, young carriers experience distress that is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of older mutation-positive women [8]�[9], as they adjust to their mutation status and consider limited proven risk management options. 10.1371/journal.pone.0087696.t001 Table 1 A Suggested Risk Management Strategy for BRCA1/2 Mutation-Positive Women. ??BREAST CANCER RISK MANAGEMENT ??By age 30, breast cancer risk is 3.4% for BRCA1 and 1.5% for BRCA2 mutation-positive women Breast self-examination [BSE] starting at either 18 or 20 years of age [27]. ? BSE not proven effective to detect early BC or to reduce mortality [28]. ? Low sensitivity to palpable breast abnormalities in young women may result in a false sense of security [28]. Clinical breast examinations [CBE] beginning between 20 and 25 [27]. ? Frequent biopsies may increase anxiety [16], [29] Mammography and/or MRI between ages 25 and 30, or 5�10 years earlier than youngest age at first BC diagnosis in the family [27]. ? The relationship between ionizing radiation exposure and breast cancer risk in mutation carriers remains unclear [29]�[30]. ? High density of young women's breast tissue often makes mammograms diagnostically inconclusive [31]. ? Frequent biopsies may increase anxiety [32]. Tamoxifen ? 50% reduction in the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women under age 50 [33]�[34]. ? Data from mutation carriers are sparse, but suggests similar benefits. ? Medication-related toxicities (e.g., endometrial cancer, DVT, stroke, particularly in women above the age of 50) have discouraged more widespread use [35] Risk reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) ? Lowers breast cancer risk by ?95% for women without a breast cancer diagnosis [36]; the breast cancer risk post-RRBM is not zero. ? Low acceptability for women who are single or dating [11], [16] ? Long-term sequelae of RRBM unknown. ??OVARIAN CANCER RISK MANAGEMENT ??By age 30, ovarian cancer risk is 1�2% for BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women Ovarian Screening, starting either at age 30 or 5�10 years earlier than the earliest age of first diagnosis in the family [37]. ?1. Transvaginal ultrasound with color Doppler ?2. CA-125 serum marker ?3. Pelvic exam every six months ? These methods are not proven to reduce morbidity or mortality from ovarian cancer. Risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) ? Lowers ovarian cancer risk by 85% for women without a breast cancer diagnosis. ? RRSO substantially lowers lifetime risk of breast cancer for premenopausal women [38], yet it increases lifetime risk of osteoporosis and heart disease [39]. ? Low tolerability in women who have generally not completed childbearing. ? Recent recognition that a significant fraction of what has been called �ovarian cancer� originated, in fact, in the fallopian tubes underscores the importance of including the fallopian tubes when RRSO is performed [23], [40] ? Hysterectomy is not routinely performed during RRSO because endometrial cancer is not considered part of the BRCA-related spectrum of cancers [41]. Tubal Ligation ? 60% reduction in ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers [42] ? Finding not consistently reproduced from one study to the next ? Preserves fertility options ____________________________________________________________________________ Oral Contraceptives ? 50% reduction in sporadic ovarian cancer risk in the general population, with protective effect greater among long-term users ? Similar reductions observed in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. ? Concerns regarding possible increased risk of breast cancer, particularly for long-term users [22] Most extant literature regarding psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2-related risk aggregates participants across the lifespan in recruitment and data analysis, obscuring development of evidence-based risk management tailored to the unique developmental needs of the youngest consumers. We sought a patient-centered perspective on the dilemmas faced by 18- to 24-year-olds as they considered BRCA1/2 genetic testing and risk management. Methods Study Participants Data were drawn from three separate qualitative studies; each used a developmental frame to investigate the experiences of BRCA1/2 mutation-carriers during their reproductive years. Beginning in 2003 and 2009, Werner-Lin [10]�[13] and Hoskins [14]�[17] independently recruited cancer-free, BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18�35 from the University of Chicago Cancer Risk Clinic and the National Cancer Institute, respectively, plus through national online organizations. All data for those studies was collected either via in-person interviews conducted in the Chicago metro area (Werner-Lin) or via telephone interview based in Bethesda, but targeting women from across the US (Hoskins) Investigators performed these investigations after approval by appropriate local Human Investigations Committees in accord with an assurance filed with and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services, where appropriate. Investigators obtained written informed consent from each participant. Data from participants aged 18�27 who were ?25 when they completed genetic testing were eligible for this secondary analysis. We chose to limit analysis to only women aged 25 or younger at the time of testing in order to understand the unique needs of these very young consumers of genetic testing services; due to the absence of clear age-specific guidelines for medical management and the complex and dense demographic shifts that occur during young adulthood (e.g., unpartnered vs. partnered, nulliparous vs. parous), we hypothesized that the needs of women in this age range would be qualitatively different from those of women in their later twenties and thirties. Alphanumeric identifiers were assigned to 26 eligible individuals (see Table 2) All underwent genetic testing between1997�2010. In 2011, a focus group was convened during the national meeting of a support/advocacy organization for women with increased breast and ovarian cancer risk [18]. English-speaking (due to constraints imposed by the researchers' language ability) women aged 18�27 who considered or completed BRCA1/2 mutation testing prior to their 25th birthday were eligible for participation. Six unaffected women aged 21�25 consented to participate. 10.1371/journal.pone.0087696.t002 Table 2 Participant Demographics (N?=?32). Age at Interview 23.2 (21�27) BRCA1 Positive 19 BRCA2 Positive 13 Relationship Status Single 13 In a committed relationship 15 Engaged or married 4 Childbearing Status Had ?1 child 2 Desired child(ren) 24 Did not want children or undecided 6 Pregnant 0 Completed or Scheduled Risk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy 5 Completed or Scheduled Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy 0 Breast or Ovarian Cancer Diagnoses 0 Data Collection In-depth interviews Investigators independently collected in-depth, semi-structured interview data from 2004�2009. Investigators' interview guide elicited data-rich reports of: family experiences with cancer and genetic testing; impact on family, peer and romantic relationships; beliefs about how cancer risk influences individual development; family formation; and attitudes towards risk-reduction. Table 3 outlines codebook themes. Originally, these data were subsumed in each investigator's study cohort, and participants of all ages combined were analyzed as one group. Data from eligible subjects were re-analyzed to examine whether themes were similar to or different from those of the entire study cohort. 10.1371/journal.pone.0087696.t003 Table 3 Codebook Excerpt. AXIAL CODES Theme?=?Navigation DEFINITION & PARAMETERS OF CODES SAMPLE PARTICIPANT QUOTES Expectations, Anticipating Change Captures participant conjecture, speculations, assumptions about their future lives, action and reactions in relation to cancer risk and family development. Automatically thought I was going to have to get rid of my breasts. I remember sitting in the shower with the shower running and sitting in there like I was taking a bath and holding my breasts and thinking, you're not worth it. Exploring Options Captures the process through which participants learned about (either pro actively or passively) their option for genetic counseling or testing and cancer risk management. So I like to learn more and more about what I should be doing for prevention wise. Even though no one really could tell me because of my age. So that's frustrating. I'm still not sure what I want to do with my breasts. Having a Plan Participants' expressions of behavioral intent, using prospective (future tense) language to describe alignment with specific courses of cancer risk management. I always wanted to be a young mom�and even more so now knowing that a lot of people with BRCA also take out their ovaries, but like I'm keeping these in until I have to take them out. I always thought that I would do that. But, now I would probably do it a lot sooner. Making Decisions Participants' expressions of resolution, commitment to certain courses of action to manage cancer risk, including explanation of decision making process (or the lack there of) and rationalizations for those actions. And I don't want to be pushed to something that is not going to work out. I cried my eyes out a little bit that day when I found out the news and I decided to just take the step forward and go. They don't make me who I am and I'm just going to go ahead forth with this because at least I can do something about it now. Taking Action Participant reports of steps complete towards their goals of minimizing cancer risk, engaging in protective health behaviors. I walked right into my ob-gyn's office and said I'm ready to get tested and they asked if � they said for insurance reasons, they asked me a couple of questions. And because I had Ashkenazi background and it got approved and that was it. I didn't have any counseling or anything before. I had that done afterwards. I did it little backwards. Living with it Participant reports of the impact on identity, quality of life, relationships, and social networks of engaging with the �cancer world� with respect to mutation status. Includes sequelae of not yet engaging in protective health behaviors. Includes watching loved ones cope with the impact of cancer risk, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality. I went through a couple of things, you know, some shock. Not shock, I don't know why. Maybe shock when you go � when you hear the statistics and the numbers, you know, it was not a good day when I found out. I'll be driving on the road � I drive a lot for work � and I will literally have daydreams that I had two kids. I'm gone. I have two kids and my husband is older and in therapy and I'm not there. That's pretty hard Focus group Investigators jointly developed a focus group guide based on findings from their earlier studies to address perspectives on: learning about cancer risk before age 25; cancer risk-management; the impact of genetic testing on identity, sexuality, family and social life; and family formation. After consenting, each participant selected a pseudonym to identify herself and within eight weeks of the 90-minute focus group, all participants completed a family history phone interview. Data Analysis All data were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed verbatim. Using the constant comparative method, investigators independently examined a subset of transcripts from each study to generate provisional codes. Once a working list of codes was established, all transcripts were reread and coded. Grounded theory techniques were used to facilitate agreement on a set of codes that best represented each dataset. Investigators approached the separate codebooks as three waves of data collection to capture changes to standard care protocols, public policy addressing insurance and discrimination concerns, and the social perceptions of genetic susceptibility during each time frame (i.e., 2004, 2009, 2011) Findings Participant Demographics Data from 32 women aged 21�27 (mean age?=?23.2) were included in the current analysis. All were confirmed BRCA1 (n?=?19) or BRCA2 (n?=?13) mutation carriers. At the time of initial data collection, 13 women were single, 15 were in relationships, and 4 were engaged/married. Two had children, 24 planned to have children, and six did not want children or were undecided. None had developed breast or ovarian cancer. None were pregnant, and none reported pursuing genetic testing to inform family planning. The majority had made active lifestyle choices to support healthy living since learning their mutation status. Five had completed risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) or had the procedure scheduled in the coming months; none had scheduled or completed risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Provider recommendations Overall, participants expressed satisfaction with the care they received from the variety of providers with whom they had contact during the process of genetic testing and initiation of risk management. Participants valued providers who acknowledged their priorities, fears, and obligations. Numbers after each participant pseudonym indicate age at the time of data collection. Reza (25) shared: A doctor [said], �Right now there's really no reason to (have a mastectomy) In the next few years there's probably going to be advances. I'm not telling you to wait fifteen years�� Because in my head it was, why should I wait until after I get cancer? But he was, like, �Wait till you're thirty.� And I was, like, �Okay, that makes sense to me.� Pam's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 32, so Pam (22) initiated screening at 21 [19]. She was satisfied with her providers' dialogue about risk-reducing surgery, reporting: �They said the breasts have to go by 25. And between 30 and 35 the ovaries would need to go. I went to the surgeon and talked to her about it, and I gave her my reasons for not wanting to wait, she agreed with me. Which was nice.� Needing guidance and autonomy Nineteen participants knew of the BRCA1/2 mutation in their family prior to their own genetic testing. Yet, many found it difficult to have their requests for screening adequately addressed. Monique (25) remembered, ��everybody was like, �oh, you're too young to know what you want.�� the primary response was never, �no, you shouldn't do it because medically it's not necessary.� Incompletely developed genetic and health literacy led several participants to misunderstand their risk of inheriting a mutation, cancer risk estimates associated with being a mutation carrier, or the residual risk of cancer post surgical risk-reduction. Linda (23) completed genetic testing at her gynecologist's suggestion. She recalled receiving her test results: I got a phone call from my gynecologist saying, �I was afraid of this but you tested positive.� And I was like, �test positive for what? I have no idea what you're talking about.� And she was like, �for the genetic mutation.� Had I been smart I would have seen the genetics counselor first. A lack of clear expectations about genetic testing and the implications of one's carrier status complicated participants' interpretation of test results. Hannah (19) provided an example of a common misunderstanding of statistics at they relate to genetic risk. She reported: (T)he way the genetic counselor explained it to us � there's only like a 25% chance of us both having it. [Since I have it], it's less likely [my sister] has it. Hannah did not understand that one sister's mutation status was unrelated to the other's individual probability of being a mutation carrier [20], [21]. Each child of a mutation-positive parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Participants acknowledged that incomplete health literacy increased their need for expert guidance. Melissa (27) stated, �some of the research is conflicting concerning different things, and it sort of perturbed me that it wasn't presented to me that way. It was presented to me as �never take birth control.�� Melissa wanted her providers to directly address the uncertainty regarding birth control pills. Yet, participants also valued autonomy in making choices; they wanted to weigh differing perspectives to come to a decision that best fit their own needs, rather than having their providers make choices for them. Inconsistent, incomplete recommendations Participants expressed frustration at receiving inconsistent, inaccurate, ambiguous or incomplete recommendations from providers regarding their cancer risk management. During the initial phase of their mutation-positive experiences, participants reported receiving information from genetic counselors, oncologists, obstetrician/gynecologists, breast surgeons, and general practitioners, each with her/his own discipline-specific perspective and knowledge base. Hannah reported, �I never took birth control because, in the beginning, they thought those hormones could actually be really negative for me. Now I hear, �We were wrong. You should have been taking birth control all these years.�� In the early years of managing women with BRCA1/2 mutations, one major concern related to the possibility that exogenous hormones might further increase the risk of breast cancer � the most frequent syndrome-related malignancy. Newer data suggest that there is little evidence of increased breast cancer risk among mutation carriers using oral contraceptive formulations prescribed since 1975, while a 50% reduction in the risk of BRCA-related ovarian cancer is now widely accepted as an important benefit related to OC exposure [22]. Since BRCA-related male breast cancer penetrance is so much lower than that for females, providers and consumers often mistakenly believe hereditary risk of breast/ovarian cancer is passed only through the maternal bloodline. Ruth recalled a physician telling her that since cancer was present on the paternal side of her family, she �[didn't] have anything to worry about, or maybe we'll start giving you a mammogram a little bit earlier than normal.� Isabelle (22), whose mother developed breast cancer at age 25, was frustrated by her inability to access screening; despite a letter signed by a doctor confirming her need for MRI, another provider refused to start screening before she turned 25. Given her family history, she perceived this to be too late. Alysha (26), who sought out a great deal of information online, shared �(I was) very frustrated with the conflicting information that doctors were telling me, particularly about screening � when and how often and the consequences of various tests.� Participation in the annual meeting of a consumer advocacy group validated her desire to gather information to feel well-informed. After attending the conference, she reported �I feel much better informed about what I should be doing and what those types of screenings actually do and possible side effects and accuracy.� Genetic testing at age 18 confirmed Lynn (23) carried a mutation, yet she received the message from her physician that �you don't need a mammogram at this age.� This led her to feel out of place in the healthcare system and frustrated at her inability to access screening. Feeling �paralyzed� by this roadblock, she completed bilateral mastectomy at age 22, believing it to be the only way to effectively manage her cancer risk [17]. Family formation Like older mutation-positive women in the two original study cohorts [11], [13], participants were concerned about the challenges presented by HBOC risk and family formation. They discussed the need to plan for varied ways to sequence risk-management and family formation plans to attend confidently to both. Several recalled providers who suggested that they advance family formation goals quickly to support risk-management. Tracy (26) recalled, I was talking to my genetic counselor, saying �I'm finally ready to get my breasts removed, who should I contact?� She found me the best surgeon in the state, who's wonderful. And she said �If you're still not interested in having kids, they've discovered tubal ligation can reduce your [ovarian cancer] risk. This might be a good option for you.� Ashley (24) recalled that her physician told her ��to start thinking about having kids before I'm 30 because if you breastfeed before you're 30, it reduces your risk of breast cancer� and she reported thinking, �oh jeez, I gotta get moving here.� Charlotte (25) recalled that physicians she saw in the context of a research study told her to �start having kids at any time, get that done with..,� contributing to her feeling of urgency to complete childbearing so that RRSO could be pursued. Although Ashley experienced this recommendation as informative and supportive, Charlotte was distressed by her perceived need to act quickly. Reza's mother was in active chemotherapy treatment following her second ovarian cancer recurrence in three years. Reza (25) wanted to undergo RRSO, but her providers advised against it. She shared, �Nobody would give me a reason that seemed real besides �you're too young, you'll want to have kids someday.� Sara (22) also met with resistance about her decision to undergo RRSO, despite her certainty that she did not wish to have biological children. She lamented, �I've gone to the doctor and expressed my fear of cancer. There's never been the acknowledgement of, �okay I hear you, you don't wanna have kids; if you wanna do surgery now, that's great.�� Discussion Barriers to effective utilization of the healthcare system to reduce mutation-related cancer risk lead young women to feel uncertain about risk-management, concerned about reproductive decisions, and pressured to make quick choices. Participants valued providers who addressed their priorities and obligations. They desperately wanted evidence-based guidance to inform their decisions, yet they reported receiving incomplete and inconsistent recommendations from providers with limited expertise in hereditary cancer risk assessment and management. Participants experienced being treated as too young both to know what they wanted and to make major healthcare decisions independently. Incomplete health literacy led many participants to overestimate their cancer risk, focusing on lifetime rather than shorter-term, and relative rather than absolute risk, indicating the need for providers with quantitative expertise in hereditary cancer genetics to facilitate ongoing education. The combination of inflated short-term risk perceptions, limited proven age-specific risk management strategies, and well-intentioned but inaccurate provider recommendations all created pressure to rush childbearing, so that surgical risk-reduction could be implemented. Utilization of services from genetically-oriented providers may support patients' acquisition of developmentally and medically sound knowledge of cancer risk and risk management. The Affordable Care Act of 2010, which requires group health plans to provide coverage for dependent children of policy-holders until their 26th birthday, may levy additional pressure to decide early about risk-reducing surgery [24]. Discrepancies in responding to cancer risk Inaccurate cancer risk perceptions may increase distress in young women, cause them to delay genetic testing (if risk is inaccurately perceived as low), or to initiate risk-reducing surgery precipitously (if short-term risk is inaccurately perceived as very high) Rapid uptake of risk-reducing surgery following genetic testing, as seen in our sample, is driven by the perception that cancer risk is imminent. The need to accurately convey short-to-intermediate cancer risk (over 5�10 years) represents a major challenge. Our data suggest discrepancies may exist between patient and provider responses to inherited cancer risk, further indicating the need for providers with expertise in both cancer genetics and the developmental needs of adolescents transitioning to adulthood. Providers may have difficulty believing that a 20-year-old faces similar risks to those observed in older mutation carriers. Trust in provider recommendations seemed to erode as differences between provider and consumer expectations grew. Providers may suggest women in their 20s postpone risk-reducing surgery until after childbearing to reinforce that imminent cancer risk is quite low, or because they assume young patients prioritize having children. Yet, recommendations linking risk management and family formation may signal to patients that physicians perceive short-term risk of cancer to be very high. When young adults are not ready to commit to life-long partnerships or to become parents, these well-intentioned recommendations are interpreted as a failure to be taken seriously. Striking generational and gender socialization differences may exist between patients and providers, leaving young women struggling to feel understood by those helping them make decisions about their care. "
Breast_Cancer "Optimally, providers can convey the caring expected from an expert, while maintaining the neutrality necessary to guide patients confidently to individually-tailored and thoughtful decisions. Implications for practice Ideally, young women would learn all the facets of risk management early in their experience as mutation carriers, allowing them to manage risk confidently. However, our data suggest that rapid developmental changes common during the transition to adulthood may necessitate a prolonged period of care for young women, whose needs are distinct from older mutation carriers for whom standard practice guidelines and clinical trials were designed. In the context of limited evidence, young women need to work methodically with providers who are knowledgeable and non-judgmental, to avoid rushing into decisions inconsistent with their life goals. Provider recommendations may be carefully tailored to attend to developmental readiness while still providing an integrated approach to care. Such a model may enable ongoing connection with patients as shifting life circumstances precipitate interest in more aggressive risk-reduction strategies. Limitations & Strengths Participants received care over a thirteen-year period during which the treatment of BRCA-related cancer risk evolved. We maintained separate codebooks for each study to ensure temporal differences in standards of care and public policy were accounted for during analysis. All three studies recruited women who completed genetic testing before age 25. However, none recruited individuals aged 18�20 at the time of data collection. None enrolled racial or ethnic minority women, subpopulations which are under-represented in high-risk clinics. Uptake of genetic testing remains particularly low for women of African descent [25], and is further complicated by their higher incidence of genetic variants that are uninformative regarding risk stratification [26]. Conclusions Young BRCA1/2 mutation carriers comprise a unique subset of high-risk women who require particularly thoughtful individualized expert care to meet their complex needs. Insuring accurate understanding of absolute short-term cancer risk is essential to informed decision-making.

Patients and Methods Whole-genome molecular inversion probe arrays were used to evaluate copy number imbalances (CNIs) in breast tumors from 960 early-stage patients with information about site of metastasis. The CoxBoost algorithm was used to select metastasis site-related CNIs and to fit a Cox proportional hazards model. Results Gains at 1q41 and 1q42.12 and losses at 1p13.3, 8p22, and Xp11.3 were significantly associated with bone metastasis. Gains at 2p11.2, 3q21.3�22.2, 3q27.1, 10q23.1, and 14q13.2�3 and loss at 7q21.11 were associated with non-bone metastasis. To examine the joint effect of CNIs and clinical predictors, patients were stratified into three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) based on the sum of predicted linear hazard ratios (HRs). For bone metastasis, the hazard (95% confidence interval) for the low-risk group was 0.32 (0.11�0.92) compared to the intermediate-risk group and 2.99 (1.74�5.11) for the high-risk group. For non-bone metastasis, the hazard for the low-risk group was 0.34 (0.17�0.66) and 2.33 (1.59�3.43) for the high-risk group. The prognostic value of loss at 8p22 for bone metastasis and gains at 10q23.1 for non-bone metastasis, and gain at 11q13.5 for both bone and non-bone metastases were externally validated in 335 breast tumors pooled from four independent cohorts. Conclusions Distinct CNIs are independently associated with bone and non-bone metastasis for early-stage breast cancer patients across cohorts. These data warrant consideration for tailoring surveillance and management of metastasis risk.

Previous studies indicate that the level of human endogenous retrovirus type K (group HERV-K(HML-2)) transcription may be increased in human breast tumors. We hypothesized that HERV-K(HML-2) reactivation can serve as a biomarker for early detection of breast cancer. Serum samples were collected from women without cancer (controls) and patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer. ELISA assays were employed to detect serum anti-HERV-K(HML-2) antibody titers. RNA was extracted from sera and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR to quantitate the level of HERV-K(HML-2) mRNA. We measured significantly higher serum mRNA and serum antibody titers against HERV-K(HML-2) proteins in women with DCIS and stage I disease than in women without cancer."
Breast_Cancer "At optimized cutoffs for the antibody titers, the assay produced an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.00) for DCIS and of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.00) for invasive breast cancer. These AUCs are comparable to those observed for mammograms. We also found that serum HERV-K(HML-2) mRNA tended to be higher in breast cancer patients with a primary tumor who later on developed the metastatic disease than in patients who did not develop cancer metastasis. Our results show that HERV-K(HML-2) antibodies and mRNA are already elevated in the blood at an early stage of breast cancer, and further increase in patients who are at risk of developing a metastatic disease.

In this study, we show that dimethoxycurcumin (DMC), a methylated, more stable analog of curcumin, is significantly more potent than curcumin in inducing cell death and reducing the clonogenicity of malignant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, DMC reduces the tumor growth of xenografted MDA-MB 435S cells more strongly than curcumin. We found that DMC induces paraptosis accompanied by excessive dilation of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); this is similar to curcumin, but a much lower concentration of DMC is required to induce this process. DMC inhibits the proteasomal activity more strongly than curcumin, possibly causing severe ER stress and contributing to the observed dilation. DMC treatment upregulates the protein levels of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and Noxa, and the small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of CHOP, but not Noxa, markedly attenuates DMC-induced ER dilation and cell death. Interestingly, DMC does not affect the viability, proteasomal activity or CHOP protein levels of human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that DMC effectively induces paraptosis selectively in breast cancer cells, while sparing normal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that DMC triggers a stronger proteasome inhibition and higher induction of CHOP compared with curcumin, giving it more potent anticancer effects on malignant breast cancer cells. dimethoxycurcumin curcumin paraptosis malignant breast cancer cells proteasomal inhibition Breast cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing over the past four decades and there are relatively few effective therapies for advanced-stage disease. Despite improvement in treatment options, the mortality of breast cancer patients has remained stable. Thus, many scientists are currently seeking new anticancer agents with better efficiency and fewer side effects. Curcumin has demonstrated selective killing of various cancer cell types, while sparing normal cells.2, 3, 4 Despite the cancer-selective cytotoxic effects of curcumin, however, its clinical use has been limited by poor systemic bioavailability, poor absorption, rapid metabolism and conjugation in the gastrointestinal tract.5 In order to overcome these issues, new improved analogs of curcumin have been synthesized and tested.6, 7, 8 Dimethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a methylated analog, in which the phenolic-OH groups of curcumin have been replaced with methoxy groups.9, 10 Tamvakopoulos et al.11 showed that DMC is more stable in cultured cells and in vivo, and has increased bioavailability compared with curcumin. In addition, DMC more potently induced apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells11 and Caki renal cancer cells,12 but was less toxic in lymphocytes,10 compared with curcumin. However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DMC have not been fully explored. Here, we show for the first time that DMC demonstrates more potent anticancer effects than curcumin on malignant breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, while sparing normal breast cells. We further report that DMC induces paraptosis at much lower doses than curcumin. Sperandio et al.13 first introduced the concept of �paraptosis' as an alternative, nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death. This mode of cell death lacks the characteristic apoptotic features (e.g., nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies) and does not respond to the typical inhibitors of apoptosis (e.g., caspase inhibitors and Bcl-xL). Observations that paraptosis can be inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX) indicate that the process requires protein synthesis,3, 13, 14, 15 thereby distinguishing it from necrosis.13 Paraptosis is also insensitive to various autophagy inhibitors.3, 15 Ultrastructural observation of cells undergoing paraptosis has identified cytoplasmic vacuolation as being characteristic of this process; the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) first swell, and then fuse to create large vacuoles.3 Paraptosis appears to occur during the development of the nervous system, as well as in some cases of neurodegeneration.13, 16 Paraptotic cells in brain tissues were observed to be filled with small and large vacuoles.17 In addition, various stimuli, including paclitaxel,18 curcumin3, 19 and ophiobolin A,20 reportedly induce paraptosis or paraptosis-like cell death in resistant malignant cancer cells, suggesting that paraptosis may provide a strategy for overcoming innate and acquired resistance to the current pro-apoptotic anticancer therapies. However, the molecular basis of paraptosis is still poorly defined, and additional evidence is required to confirm the authentic biochemical markers of this process. ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix) has been identified as an inhibitor of paraptosis.3, 14, 21, 22, 23 In addition, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation has been associated with paraptosis induced by insulin-like growth factor I receptor,14 1-nitropyrene,23 paclitaxel,24 curcumin,3, 19 celastrol25 and yessotoxin,26 although the importance of the respective MAP kinase differs depending on the stimulus.3, 14, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26 We recently showed that proteasomal dysfunction and the generation of mitochondrial superoxide are critical for the curcumin-induced dilation of mitochondria and/or the ER and subsequent paraptotic cell death in breast cancer cells.3 In this study, we provide evidence suggesting that the ability of DMC to effectively induce paraptosis via potent proteasomal inhibition and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) upregulation may be responsible for its improved anticancer effects on malignant breast cancer cells, compared with curcumin. Results DMC demonstrates more potent anticancer effects on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo than curcumin To evaluate the anticancer activity of DMC on various breast cancer cells, we first compared its cytotoxic effects with those of curcumin (Figure 1a). We found that DMC treatment more potently induced cell death in various breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1b). Although the IC50 values for curcumin were 151.95, 76.27, 37.48 and 34.75??M for T-47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB 435S and MDA-MB 231 cells, respectively, those of DMC were 21.75, 23.62, 20.05 and 22.44??M, respectively. We then compared the effects of curcumin and DMC on the long-term survival and found that treatment with 10??M DMC for 12?h completely blocked the clonogenicity of MDA-MB 435S cells, whereas at least 30??M curcumin was required to achieve the same effect (Figure 1c). Furthermore, 10??M DMC required a much shorter incubation time than 10??M curcumin to inhibit the clonogenicity of these cells. These results show that the anticancer effects of DMC on long-term survival appear to be greater than that on in vitro cytotoxicity to breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in MDA-MB 231 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we examined the anticancer effects of curcumin and DMC in vivo. Nude mice were xenografted with MDA-MB 435S cells, injected with curcumin or DMC at two doses (25 and 50?mg/kg) at intervals of 2 days for 20 days and tumor sizes were estimated. Both curcumin and DMC dose-dependently reduced the tumor sizes, but the tumor-reducing effect of DMC at 25?mg/kg was greater than that of curcumin at 50?mg/kg (Figure 1d), suggesting that DMC demonstrates a more potent in vivo anticancer effect than curcumin. To further confirm the in vivo anticancer effects of curcumin or DMC, we utilized bioluminescence imaging, which is a more sensitive measure of tumor growth than caliper measurement. Nude mice were injected with MDA-MB 435S cells engineered to express luciferase (MDA-MB 435S/Luc). Once a palpable mass was detectable (about 2 weeks), mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, 50?mg/kg curcumin or DMC every 2 days for 20 days. Bioluminescent imaging analysis showed that DMC more effectively reduced the luciferase activity in tumors compared with curcumin, indicating again that DMC inhibited tumor growth more strongly than curcumin (Figure 1e). Collectively, these results indicate that DMC demonstrates more potent anticancer effects than curcumin when tested on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. DMC effectively kills malignant breast cancer cells via induction of paraptosis Investigation of the cellular morphologies showed that marked vacuolation commonly preceded cell death in DMC-treated MDA-MB 435S, MDA-MB 231, MCF-7 and T-47D cells (Figure 2a). We did not observe the morphological features of apoptosis, including cellular shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing and apoptotic bodies, in these DMC-treated breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the DMC-induced cell death of MDA-MB 435S cells was not inhibited by various caspase-specific inhibitors, and caspase-8, -9 and -3 were not noticeably processed by DMC (Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting that apoptosis is not involved in the DMC-induced death of these breast cancer cells. In addition, hematoxylin and eoxin staining also showed severe cellular vacuolation (without noticeable nuclear condensation or fragmentation) in the sections of MDA-MB 435S xenografts treated with 25?mg/kg DMC at intervals of 2 days for 20 days, compared with those treated with vehicle (Figure 2b). When we examined whether autophagy was involved in DMC-induced cell death, DMC-induced cell death was not affected by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine (CQ) (Figure 2c). However, interestingly, both I and II forms of LC3, but not ATG5 and ATG6, were upregulated by DMC (Figure 2d). As LC3 was critically involved in cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death induced by 15d-PGJ2,27 we next tested whether upregulation of LC3 has a role in DMC-induced vacuolation and subsequent cell death. We found that neither DMC-induced cell death nor vacuolation was affected by knockdown of LC3 (Figures 2e and f). Thus, our results show that autophagy and LC3 are not involved in the DMC-induced cell death of breast cancer cells. Next, we tested whether the vacuoles induced by DMC treatment may originate from mitochondria and/or the ER. When we used MDA-MB 435S sublines expressing fluorescence selectively in mitochondria (YFP-Mito cells) or the ER (YFP-ER cells), we found that at 16?h of 20??M DMC treatment, dilation of mitochondria was noted around the nuclei and a lot of small ER-derived vacuoles were also observed at the cellular periphery (Figure 3a). These vacuoles originating from both mitochondria and the ER were progressively enlarged by the prolonged exposure to DMC. When we quantitatively measured the sizes of these vacuoles, the average width of the mitochondria-derived vacuoles and that of the ER-derived vacuoles were 1.42 and 4.93??m, respectively, at 24?h of DMC treatment (Figure 3b). Immunocytochemistry of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COX IV), a mitochondrial protein, and protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI), an ER resident protein, showed that COX IV expression in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with DMC for 16?h was observed at the boundary of vacuoles around the nuclei, whereas PDI expression was mainly detected at the boundary of enlarged vacuoles at the cellular periphery (Figure 3c). When we performed electron microscopy, most of the mitochondria had disrupted cristae and they were swollen in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with 20??M DMC for 12?h (Figure 3d). Furthermore, megamitochondria arising from fusion among swollen mitochondria were frequently observed at this time. In cells treated with 20??M DMC for 24?h, there were numerous fusions between swollen sections of the ER and almost the entire cellular space except the nucleus was occupied by dilated ER and a few megamitochondria. When we compared the dose-dependent effects of curcumin and DMC, we found that about fourfold higher concentration of curcumin was necessary to induce a similar extent of cellular vacuolation (Figure 3e). Accordingly, we examined whether DMC induced more effective induction of paraptosis is responsible for its stronger anticancer effects than those of curcumin. As paraptotic cell death is known to require protein synthesis,13, 14 we first tested the effect of CHX on DMC-induced cell death. We found that pre-treatment of MDA-MB 435S cells with 2??M CHX almost completely blocked DMC-induced cell death and cellular vacuolation (Figure 4a and b). In addition, treatment with 20??M DMC reduced the protein levels of Alix, an inhibitor of paraptosis,14 more rapidly and markedly than treatment with 40??M curcumin (Figure 4c). As MAP kinases have been positively associated with paraptosis,3, 14, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26 we examined the functional significance of various MAP kinases in DMC-induced cell death and found that inhibition of the ERK pathway (using PD98059 or U0126) or the JNK pathway (using L-JNK Inhibitor 1 (L-JNKI)), but not inhibition of p38 (using SB203580), significantly inhibited DMC-induced cell death (Figure 4d). Western blot analysis showed that the activities of ERK and JNK were markedly and similarly increased by treatment with 20??M DMC or 40??M curcumin (Figure 4e). Previously, we have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular mitochondrial superoxide, and proteasomal inhibition critically contribute to the paraptosis induced by curcumin.3 Thus, we first attempted to examine the functional significance of ROS in DMC-induced cell death. We found that DMC-induced cell death was very effectively blocked by pre-treatment with either Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP; the MnSOD mimetic) or copper[II]diisopropyl salicylate (CuDIPS; the CuZnSOD mimetic), but not catalase (Figure 4f). FACS analysis using MitoSOX-Red showed that mitochondrial superoxide levels were time- and dose-dependently increased by DMC (Figure 4g), indicating that the increased mitochondrial superoxide has a critical role in DMC-induced cell death. Comparison of the mitochondrial superoxide levels in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with curcumin or DMC for 4?h revealed that DMC increased mitochondrial superoxide levels to a greater extent than curcumin (Figure 4h). Next, we tested whether DMC treatment could also inhibit proteasomal activity, as reflected by increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Treatment with 20??M DMC progressively increased the accumulation of protein�ubiquitin conjugates (Figure 4i), whereas pre-treatment with CHX completely blocked the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 4j). Collectively, our results show that paraptosis is a major mode of cell death by DMC in malignant breast cancer cells. DMC more potently induces proteasomal inhibition and CHOP upregulation, compared with curcumin Next, we examined whether the more potent anticancer effects of DMC over curcumin are associated with the increased inhibition of the proteasome and we found that the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates in DMC-treated cells far exceeded that in curcumin-treated cells at each dose (Figure 5a). Immunocytochemistry of ubiquitin also showed that the expression levels of ubiquitin were more notably elevated in MDA-MB 453S cells treated with 20??M DMC than those treated with 20??M curcumin (Figure 5b). Accordingly, we compared the effects of curcumin and DMC on cellular proteasome activities. The 20S proteasome is a multicatalytic protease of the 26S proteasome complex that has multiple peptidase activities, including chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing-like (PGPH-like) activities.28 Consistent with the increased accumulation of protein�ubiquitin conjugates, treatment of MDA-MB 435S cells with DMC more effectively reduced chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and PGPH-like activities compared with the same doses of curcumin (Figure 5c). As synthetic fluorogenic substrates can be cleaved not only by the 20S proteasome, but also by other proteases present in cell lysates, we investigated the direct effects of curcumin or DMC on the proteolytic activities of the purified 20S proteasome. Although both curcumin and DMC dose-dependently inhibited the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and PGPH-like hydrolytic activities of the purified 20S proteasome, the inhibitory effect of DMC was greater than that of curcumin (Figure 5d). Taken together, these results suggest that, compared with curcumin, DMC exhibits a more potent inhibitory effect against proteasomal activity in malignant breast cancer cells. As proteasomal inhibition is known to induce ER stress, we examined the expression of ER stress-associated proteins in DMC-treated cells. The protein levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CHOP were markedly increased after 4?h of DMC treatment, whereas KDEL protein levels were not noticeably affected (Figure 5e). In addition, the protein levels of Bim29 and Noxa,29, 30 which were reportedly associated with the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitor (PI), were also progressively increased by DMC treatment. Curcumin and DMC had similar effects on Bim and KDEL, slightly increasing the protein levels of Bim but not noticeably altering the expression of KDEL (Figure 5f). Interestingly, however, DMC treatment markedly increased the protein levels of CHOP, ATF4 and Noxa at much lower doses compared with curcumin (Figure 5f). CHOP upregulation critically contributes to DMC-induced paraptosis As ATF4 was reported to confer resistance to proteasomal inhibition,31 we investigated whether CHOP or Noxa may have a critical role in DMC-induced cell death. Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of CHOP, but not that of Noxa, significantly inhibited DMC-induced cell death (Figure 6a), indicating that CHOP may be critically involved in DMC-induced paraptosis. Interestingly, CHOP knockdown did not affect the DMC-induced accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 6b), suggesting that the DMC-induced upregulation of CHOP may act downstream of proteasomal impairment. Next, we used YFP-Mito and YFP-ER cells to investigate whether CHOP knockdown affected the DMC-induced dilation of mitochondria and/or the ER. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP markedly inhibited DMC-induced dilation of the ER, compared with its effect on DMC-induced mitochondrial dilation (Figures 6c, 6d, and Supplementary Figure 3). We further confirmed the effect of CHOP knockdown on DMC-induced dilation of mitochondria and the ER by immunocytochemistry of CHOP, PDI and COX IV. In MDA-MB 435S cells infected with the lentivirus containing the non-targeting small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and further treated with DMC for 16?h, CHOP was highly expressed at the nuclei (Figure 6e). At this condition, PDI was expressed at the boundary of dilated ER vacuoles, whereas COX IV was expressed within the dilated mitochondria. When we treated MDA-MB 435S cells with the lentivirus containing CHOP-targeting shRNA, DMC-induced cellular vacuolation was markedly attenuated. In addition, expression patterns of PDI following treatment with DMC were much similar to those of untreated cells, although mitochondria-expressing COX IV appeared somewhat dilated. Taken together, these results suggest that DMC-induced proteasomal inhibition leads to the upregulation of CHOP, critically contributing to dilation of the ER and paraptotic cell death. Accordingly, we examined whether DMC also inhibits proteasomal activity and increases CHOP protein levels more potently than curcumin in vivo. We found that DMC treatment more markedly increased the protein levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and CHOP compared with curcumin treatment in tumor specimens from nude mice harboring MDA-MB 435S cell xenografts (Figure 6f). Taken together, our results indicate that enhanced proteasome inhibition and CHOP upregulation may be responsible for the more potent anticancer effects of DMC on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. DMC does not inhibit proteasomal activity or cell viability in normal breast cells Finally, we examined the effects of DMC on normal breast cells. Similar to curcumin, treatment of MCF-10A cells or human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) with DMC up to 30??M did not induce any cell death (Figure 7a) or alterations in cell morphology (Figure 7b), suggesting that DMC is selectively cytotoxic to malignant breast cancer cells, while sparing normal breast cells. Furthermore, the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and the upregulation of CHOP, both of which were observed in DMC-treated MDA-MB 435S cells, did not occur in HMECs (Figure 7c). Immunocytochemistry of ubiquitin and CHOP also showed that the expression levels of ubiquitin in the cytosol and nuclear CHOP were markedly increased in MDA-MB 435S cells, but not in HMECs, following treatment with 20??M DMC (Figure 7d). In addition, DMC-induced downregulation of Alix and upregulation of Noxa and Bim, which were shown in MDA-MB 435S cells, were not observed in HMECs (Figure 7e). Furthermore, flow cytometry using MitoSOX-Red showed that DMC induced marked increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels, which were detected in MDA-MB 435S cells, were not observed in HMECs (Figure 7f). Taken together, our results indicate that DMC-induced activation of these paraptosis-associated signals, including proteasome inhibition (possibly leading to the upregulation of CHOP,32 Noxa29 and Bim29, 30), Alix downregulation and superoxide generation, may contribute to its selective cytotoxicity to breast cancer cells, sparing normal cells. Discussion Despite the promise of curcumin as a chemopreventive33, 34 and cancer-selective therapeutic agent,2, 3, 4 clinical trials have revealed that curcumin suffers from poor absorption, low bioavailability, low plasma levels, rapid metabolism and quick elimination from the body.35 Therefore, the potential clinical benefits of curcumin await improvements in its bioavailability. Many research groups have developed new synthetic analogs of curcumin;6, 7, 8 these include DMC, which shows potential as a potent chemotherapeutic agent.11, 12, 36 However, no previous study has assessed the comparative anticancer effects of DMC and curcumin against breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that DMC induces the death of various breast cancer cells, reduces the clonogenicities of MDA-MB 435S and MDA-MB 231 cells at much lower doses compared with curcumin, and more potently inhibited the growth of tumor xenografted with MDA-MB 435S cells in vivo. In this study, we propose that the improved effects of DMC over curcumin in malignant breast cancer cells are due to more effective induction of paraptosis. Although the molecular basis of paraptosis is still not clearly understood, we conclude that DMC induces paraptosis based on the following morphological and biochemical characteristics: (a) DMC induces the swelling and fusion of mitochondria and the ER; (b) DMC-induced vacuolation and cell death is completely inhibited by CHX; (c) the protein levels of Alix, which is a known inhibitor of paraptosis,14 are downregulated by DMC; (d) DMC increases mitochondrial superoxide levels and antioxidants significantly block DMC-induced cell death; and (e) DMC inhibits proteasomal activity. Furthermore, we show here for the first time that CHOP has a critical role in DMC-induced paraptosis, particularly in the context of ER dilation. We recently showed that proteasomal dysfunction critically contributes to curcumin-induced paraptosis in malignant breast cancer cells.3 It has been reported that human cancer cells possess elevated proteasomal activity37 and are more sensitive to PIs than normal cells,38, 39 indicating that the ubiquitin�proteasome pathway is a promising target for cancer therapy. Bortezomib, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved PI, is clinically used for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma40, 41 Giant ER-derived vacuoles have been increasingly recognized as indicating perturbation of the functional link between the ER and the proteasome.3, 42 Failure of the proteasomal machinery leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and cytoplasm; this can overwhelm cells and lead to failure of the unfolded protein response and ER-associated degradation, both of which protect cells from proteotoxicity.27 Here, we found that DMC induced a greater accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in MDA-MB 435S cells and a mouse xenograft tumor model, compared with curcumin. In addition, DMC more potently inhibited chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and PGPH-like activities (versus curcumin) in experiments using MDA-MB 435S cell lysates or purified 20S proteasomes. Collectively, these results indicate that DMC inhibits the proteasome more potently than curcumin, contributing to more effective induction of paraptosis. When we further examined the significance of various signals associated with PI-mediated ER stress and/or toxicity, we found that DMC upregulated CHOP more potently than curcumin, and CHOP knockdown significantly attenuated DMC-induced cell death. Interestingly, DMC-induced ER dilation was almost completely blocked by CHOP knockdown, although DMC-induced dilation of mitochondria was not greatly affected by it. We found that curcumin-induced ER dilation was also effectively blocked by CHOP knockdown (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting that CHOP may have a critical role in paraptosis, particularly in the context of ER dilation. Further work is warranted to determine whether CHOP transcriptionally controls the expression of gene products responsible for DMC-induced dilation of the ER. Collectively, our results indicate that the upregulation of CHOP via DMC-induced proteasomal inhibition has a critical role in the induction of paraptosis, contributing to the more potent anticancer effects of DMC on malignant breast cancer cells, compared with curcumin. Mechanistically, curcumin and DMC are both Michael acceptors (?, ?-unsaturated ?-diketo group) that can react with sulfhydryl groups.43 This can induce oxidative stress by altering the cellular redox balance, potentially elevating the levels of ROS.44 Kunwar et al.10 showed that, similar to curcumin, DMC increased the generation of ROS in tumor cells. When we compared the mitochondrial superoxide levels in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with curcumin or DMC for 4?h, we found that DMC increased mitochondrial superoxide levels to a greater extent than curcumin (Figure 4h). The proteasome is known to be susceptible to oxidative modification and inactivation,45, 46 so we presume that the severity of this DMC-induced oxidative stress may contribute to its more potent impairment of proteasomal activity. Furthermore, owing to cross-regulation, DMC-induced proteasomal inhibition may also further facilitate ROS induction by eliciting ER stress.47 Identification of effective paraptotic inducers and the elucidation of critical signals involved in this alternative cell death mode may facilitate the design of novel therapeutics against malignant cancer cells with defects in their apoptotic machineries. Therefore, this study may contribute to the fields of cancer therapy and cell death research by identifying DMC as a more effective paraptotic inducer than curcumin, while also clarifying the functional significance of proteasomal modulation and CHOP induction in paraptosis. To further confirm the clinical usefulness of DMC as a potential anticancer drug, future studies may be needed to examine its chemosensitizing effects for tumors and in vivo anticancer effects in a metastatic model.

Autophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis and plays important roles in tumorigenesis. FIP200 is an essential autophagy gene that promotes mammary tumorigenesis. Here, Wei et al. find that ablation of FIP200 reduces growth of established tumors. p62 knockdown or deficiency in established FIP200-null tumors dramatically impairs tumor growth, and this is associated with the up-regulated activation of the NF-?B pathway by p62. This study demonstrates that p62 and autophagy synergize to promote tumor growth. Autophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis and plays important roles in tumorigenesis. FIP200 (FAK family-interacting protein of 200 kDa) is an essential autophagy gene required for autophagy induction, functioning in the ULK1�ATG13�FIP200 complex. Our previous studies showed that conditional knockout of FIP200 significantly suppressed mammary tumorigenesis, which was accompanied by accumulation of p62 in tumor cells. However, it is not clear whether FIP200 is also required for maintaining tumor growth and how the increased p62 level affects the growth in autophagy-deficient FIP200-null tumors in vivo. Here, we describe a new system to delete FIP200 in transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as mammary tumor cells following their transplantation and show that ablation of FIP200 significantly reduced growth of established tumors in vivo. Using similar strategies, we further showed that either p62 knockdown or p62 deficiency in established FIP200-null tumors dramatically impaired tumor growth. The stimulation of tumor growth by p62 accumulation in FIP200-null tumors is associated with the up-regulated activation of the NF-?B pathway by p62. Last, we showed that overexpression of the autophagy master regulator TFEBS142A increased the growth of established tumors, which correlated with the increased autophagy of the tumor cells. Together, our studies demonstrate that p62 and autophagy synergize to promote tumor growth, suggesting that inhibition of both pathways could be more effective than targeting either alone for cancer therapy. tumor growth p62 autophagy mouse models 100890575 21417 Nat Cell Biol Nat.

However, the interactions between CSCs and their surrounding microenvironment are poorly understood. Here we show that tumor-associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMs) create a CSC-niche via juxtacrine signaling with CSCs. We performed quantitative proteomic profiling and found that the EMT program upregulates the expression of CD90/Thy1 and EphA4, which mediate the physical interactions of CSCs with TAMs by directly binding with their respective counter-receptors on these cells. In response, the EphA4 receptor on the carcinoma cells activates Src and NF-?B, the latter results in the secretion of a variety of cytokines by the CSCs; these cytokines serve to sustain the stem-cell state. Indeed, admixed macrophages enhance the CSC activities of carcinoma cells. These findings underscore the significance of TAMs as important components of the CSC niche. 0222643 5286 J Surg Oncol J Surg Oncol Journal of surgical oncology 0022-4790 1096-9098 24643795 4227499 10.1002/jso.23579 NIHMS619207 Article Determining Breast Cancer Axillary Surgery Within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Database SCHMOCKER RYAN K.

In 2011, the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program recommended against its use to determine extent of axillary surgery, leaving a gap in the utilization of claims data for breast cancer research. The objective was to develop an algorithm using SEER registry and claims data to classify extent of axillary surgery for breast cancer. Methods We analyzed data for 24,534 breast cancer patients. CPT codes and number of examined lymph nodes classified the extent of axillary surgery. The final algorithm was validated by comparing the algorithm derived extent of axillary surgery to direct chart review for 100 breast cancer patients treated at our breast center. Results Using the algorithm, 13% had no axillary surgery, 56% SLNB and 31% axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). SLNB was performed in 77% of node negative patients and ALND in 72% of node positive. In our validation study, concordance between algorithm and direct chart review was 97%. Conclusions Given recognized inaccuracies in cancer registries� �Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery� variable, these findings have high utility for health services researchers studying breast cancer treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is used for various indications. Contrary to computed tomography as a staging tool, breast MRI focuses on the breast parenchyma and axilla. In spite of narrow field of view, many structures such as the anterior portion of the lungs, mediastinum, bony structures and the liver are included which should not be neglected because the abnormalities detected on the above structures may influence the staging and provide a clue to systemic metastasis, which results in the change of treatment strategy. The purpose of this pictorial essay was to review the unexpected extra-mammary findings seen on the preoperative breast MRI. Breast Extra-mammary Magnetic resonance imaging INTRODUCTION Recently, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been accepted as an important tool for the characterization of breast lesions (1), and its clinical use has become more widespread such as for the screening in high risk groups and in women with augmentation or cosmetic injection, local staging in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, evaluation of positive surgical margin at initial excision and for the response monitoring to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Notwithstanding a relatively small field of view (FOV) and primarily focusing on the mammary glands and axillary regions, a part of other structures such as the lung, mediastinum, upper abdomen and bony thorax are included in breast MRI also (2, 3). Preoperative breast MRI is usually used for local staging such as the assessment of breast cancer extend and the evaluation of the contralateral breast, however, the lesions detected on the extra-mammary structures in that FOV can influence the staging. Irrespective of the nature of extra-mammary findings (2, 3), the detection of those findings is important, because it can be a clue of systemic metastasis or concurrent malignancy. Therefore, radiologists should pay attention not only to mammary and axillary regions but also to all the structures included in the FOV of breast MRI. The purpose of this pictorial essay was to review extra-mammary findings observed in preoperative breast MRI examinations of breast cancer patients. Lung Lesions It is known that incidentally detected lesions of lung parenchyma are highly likely to be malignant compared to lesions in other structures (4). Unexpected pulmonary nodules detected on breast MRI in patients with breast cancer are identified as one of a large spectrum of abnormalities ranging from benign to malignant lesions. The rates of these abnormalities have been reported with 34.2-75% for metastatic lesions, 11.5-48.1% for primary lung cancer and 13.5-17.7% for benign lesions (5). CT and MRI share similar criteria for raising suspicion of a malignant nature of lung nodules, such as multifocality and increase in the size and number of the nodules on follow-up examinations (6). A CT is advantageous in discriminating the nature of lung nodule(s) concerning the assessment of shape, border and density. Therefore, a CT should be considered for the differential diagnosis if the incidental lung nodule(s) are detected on breast MRI (6). We have found three cases of lung abnormalities (Figs. 1,2,3) on breast MRI. In two of them were the treatment plans changed after MRI. In one case was an incidental lung mass found in the right upper lobe (Fig. 1A) on breast MRI and this did not change on the two-year follow-up chest CT (Fig. 1B). In the second case, incidental pleural lesions with pleural effusion which were confirmed as metastases were found in the left hemithorax (Fig. 2A, B). A chest CT showed multiple pleural masses with a large amount of pleural effusion (Fig. 2C). The plan of direct operation was changed to chemotherapy after this detection. In the third case, primary lung cancer was confirmed and a simultaneous lobectomy was conducted (Fig. 3). Mediastinal Lesions When a unexpected mediastinal mass is found, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on the location within the mediastinal compartment and by age (7). Most masses (60%) located in the mediastinum are thymomas, neurogenic tumors or benign cysts. As most mediastinal cysts are developmental in origin (Fig. 4), there is no need to delay a breast cancer operation. Many mediastinal lesions, such as mediastinal lymph nodes, vascular abnormalities (e.g., aneurysms) and normal structures (e.g., pericardial recess, pericardial fat pad) can be observed on breast MRI. Normal structures can be mistaken as mediastinal mass as we obtain breast MRI with the patient in a prone position. For example, prominent pericardial fat can be seen as a contour-bulging mass in the anterior mediastinum (Fig. 5A, B). The bulging contour can be changed to a straight line on CT images (Fig. 5C) by supine positioning the patient. In addition, as this is a fat pad around the pericardium, the fat signal drops with a fat-suppressed scan. Mediastinal lymph nodes certainly represent the most common cause of mediastinal masses. A positron emission tomography (PET) for systemic evaluation should be considered if mediastinal lymph nodes are found on breast MRI (Fig. 6A, B) and CT for local staging (Fig. 6C), because the management strategy may be changed according to the status of regional lymph nodes (Fig. 6D). Liver Lesions The most frequent extra-mammary findings on breast MRI are hepatic lesions (2). Most hepatic lesions are benign and the probability of a hepatic lesion being malignant is less than 20% (2, 8). Further examinations must rely on any suspicious characteristics observed on the MRI, such as the presence of multiplicity (Figs. 7, 8), indistinct margins (Fig. 8) or rim enhancement (Fig. 8) on both, unenhanced and enhanced sequences. Further evaluation is not necessary if the lesions have typical findings such as those of a simple hepatic cyst, which show a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 7A) and no internal or rim enhancement (Fig. 7B) after contrast injection (9). However, further evaluation should be conducted (e.g., nuclear scan or CT with a liver protocol or MRI with a hepatobiliary contrast agent) if the findings are not typical for benign lesions. We report a case of left breast cancer which was widely excised at another hospital. The MRI showed numerous high signal-intensity masses on T2-weighted images, which lesions were not enhanced at all after contrast injection and suggestive of hepatic cysts. Then a subsequent lumpectomy of the left breast followed (Fig. 7). In another case with right breast cancer, multiple masses with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 8A) and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Fig. 8B) were seen, which exhibited enhancement after contrast injection (Fig. 8C, D). So, operation was cancelled and treatment plan was changed to chemotherapy. Bony Lesions Bony lesions are occasionally observed on breast MRI. More attention should be given to bony lesions, because bone is one of the most common sites for breast cancer metastasis (2, 10, 11). An early detection of metastatic disease may change treatment plans and offer a better chance of survival and quality of life. Approximately 65-75% of patients with metastatic disease from breast cancer have bone metastases (10). In a recent study, bone lesions accounted for 7% (20/285) of all incidental extra-mammary findings in breast cancer patients, and the positive predictive value for MRI to detect a metastatic lesion was high if it was located within the bone (89%) (11). Signal changes in the marrow on T1-weighted images are the most frequently observed findings. However, these findings are nonspecific and observed on both, benign (e.g., inflammation or stress fractures) (Fig. 9) and malignant lesions (Fig. 10). Typical features of bone metastases include a low signal intensity on T1- and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with peripheral edema of the bone marrow (Fig. 10) (2). Therefore, MRI with a bone protocol, bone scan or PET should be recommended if bony lesions were detected on breast MRI in patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSION Breast MRI is one of the most useful imaging modalities for the detection and characterization of breast lesions. With the widespread use of breast MRI, incidental extra-mammary findings are detected more often than before. Radiologists should pay attention not only to breasts but also to extra-mammary areas, because the prevalence of malignant incidental extra-mammary findings is not negligible and these might alter the treatment plan, particularly for breast cancer patients. The awareness of extra-mammary findings on breast MRI may lead to an early detection and appropriate management of extra-mammary findings in patients with breast cancer."

It contains three PHD fingers, the biological roles of which remain elusive. Here, we show that the first PHD1 finger of KDM5B binds unmodified histone H3, whereas the third PHD3 finger prefers the trimethylated mark, H3K4me3. RNA-seq analysis indicates that KDM5B functions as a transcriptional repressor for a set of genes. Biochemical analysis reveals that KDM5B associates with components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and may cooperate with HDAC1 in gene repression. Compared with the estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, KDM5B is downregulated in the triple-negative breast cancer. Overexpression of KDM5B in the MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells suppresses cell migration and invasion ability, and the PHD1-H3K4me0 interaction is important for inhibition of migration. These findings highlight tumor-suppressive functions of KDM5B in triple-negative breast cancer cells and suggest a novel multivalent mechanism for KDM5B-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Methods: Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and other tumor cell lines (T47D, HepG2, HeLa, and PC12) were tested. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay, and apoptosis was defined by monitoring the morphology of the nuclei and staining with Annexin V-FITC. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured using JC-1 under fluorescence microscopy. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined by Western blotting analysis. Results: Bornyl caffeate (10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L) suppressed the viability of MCF-7 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners, but neither caffeic acid nor borneol showed cytotoxicity at a concentration of 50 ?mol/L. Bornyl caffeate also exerted cytotoxicity to HepG2, Hela, T47D, and PC12 cells. Bornyl caffeate dose-dependently induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, increased the expression of Bax and decreased the expression of Bcl-xl, resulting in the disruption of MMP and subsequent activation of caspase-3. Moreover, bornyl caffeate triggered the formation of ROS and activated p38 and c-Jun JNK. In MCF-7 cells, the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate was significantly attenuated by SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), z-VAD (pan-caspase inhibitor) or the thiol antioxidant L-NAC. Conclusion: Bornyl caffeate exerts non-selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells of different origin in vitro. The compound induces apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via the ROS- and JNK-mediated pathways. bornyl caffeate anticancer drug human breast cancer T47D HepG2 HeLa PC12 apoptosis caspase-3 ROS p38 JNK Introduction Alteration of the physiological apoptotic pathways and disruption of normal homeostasis are known to cause the initiation, progression and metastasis of different cancers1,2. Pharmacological induction of apoptosis in cancer cells has emerged as a key anticancer strategy over the past several decades3,4. Drug-induced apoptosis is readily characterized by microvilli, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear collapse and cellular fragmentation into apoptotic-bodies. The anticancer activity of current anticancer drugs is mediated by multiple apoptotic mechanisms, for example, the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and caspases. The MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death5,6. ERK isoenzymes are mainly regulated by the ras/raf/MEK pathway but are also activated by MEK-1-dependent signals7,8,9. Activation of ERKs promotes the proliferation and survival of most cell types7,10 and regulates cell differentiation and apoptosis11,12. In contrast, the MAP kinases JNK and p38 are often activated by oxidative stress and xenobiotics, and they subsequently induce apoptosis and promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines7,13. Interestingly, JNK and p38 exist in multiple isoforms and function in a cell-type-specific manner14. Moreover, their individual isoenzymes may reside in different intracellular compartments and regulate different biological events15,16. Under certain circumstances, p38 and JNK could exert opposing functions and even attenuate cellular apoptotic signals17. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that p38 and/or JNK directly activate the caspase cascade, thereby mediating the activation of the apoptotic transcription factor c-jun18,19. Activation of the caspase cascade actually hallmarks cell apoptosis20, and notably, many anticancer drugs kill tumor cells by mainly activating caspases, especially caspase-33,21,22. Bornyl caffeate was initially isolated as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compound from several plants, such as Piper caninum (Piperaceae), Piper philippinum, Coreopsis mutica var mutica and Verbesina turbacenina Kunth23,24,25,26. Recent studies have further demonstrated that bornyl caffeate inhibits human neutrophil elastase, HIV-1 integrase and trypanosome cysteine protease26,27,28. The chemical structure of bornyl caffeate represents a combination of two naturally occurring, anti-inflammatory compounds, namely, borneol and caffeic acid. Borneol is widely used to treat against microorganisms, inflammation and pain in Traditional Chinese medicine and other folk medicines29,30. However, borneol could be cytotoxic and genotoxic, depending on its concentration30,31. At non-toxic concentrations, borneol attenuates the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas borneol at higher concentrations manifests synergy with H2O2, primarily by potentiating the DNA-damaging effects of H2O2. Interestingly, borneol and its derivative MT103 inhibited 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced carcinogenesis and tumor growth, while both compounds barely showed toxicity in normal cells32,33. It is believed that borneol kills cancer cells largely by inducing apoptosis. However, caffeic acid and its derivatives are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities2,34,35,36,37,38. For example, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) from insect propolis specifically induces apoptosis in tumor or virally transformed cells but not in parental, normal cells39,40. Octylcaffeate, another example, was recently synthesized and evaluated for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities35,41,42. Octylcaffeate also induces apoptosis in human cancer cells and prevents experimental lung metastasis of murine colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells43,44. The present study was designed to explore the anticancer potential of bornyl caffeate. We recently synthesized bornyl caffeate via direct esterification of caffeic acid with borneol and found that bornyl caffeate strongly induced cell death in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The research focus of the present study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Materials and methods Chemicals and antibodies The antibodies against phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, Akt, ERK, p38, and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA, USA). The antibodies against Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, caspase-3, PARP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The antibody against GAPDH and the goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St Louis, MO, USA). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St Louis, MO, USA) unless indicated otherwise. Bornyl caffeate was synthesized from caffeic acid by exhaustive esterification with borneol following a modified procedure that was described previously45. At the end of reaction, bornyl caffeate was purified by silica gel chromatography and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). In this study, bornyl caffeate was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make stock solutions of 1 mmol/L and was filtrated using a sterile filter (Millipore, USA). For cell culture, bornyl caffeate was diluted to the appropriate final concentrations in cell-culture medium. Control cells were treated with the same amount of vehicle. The DMSO concentration in the cell-culture medium was controlled below 0.1% (v/v). Cell culture MCF-7 and several other cell lines (T47D, HepG2, HeLa and PC12) were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7, T47D, HepG2, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%FBS, 5% horse serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All cells were cultured at 37 �C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Measurement of cell viability The cell viability was evaluated by a standard colorimetric assay as described previously46. In brief, the cells were seeded at 1�104/100 ?L per well in a 96-well plate and treated with 0, 10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L of bornyl caffeate for 24 h or 50 ?mol/L of bornyl caffeate for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. At the end of the drug treatment, the cell monolayers were incubated with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (0.5 mg/mL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4 h. The formation of purple formazan was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm on a microplate reader(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). To characterize the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 20 ?mol/L of different protein kinase inhibitors (LY294002, PD98059, SP600125, and SB203580) or 50 ?mol/L of z-VAD-fmk for 1 h and then treated with bornyl caffeate at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. The cell viability was determined using the MTT assay as described above. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release Extracellular LDH activity was measured using a colorimetric assay and the Cytotoxicity Cell Death Kit (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a density of 10 000 cells per well. Bornyl caffeate at various final concentrations (0, 10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L) or 50 ?mol/L of bornyl caffeate was added for the indicated times, and the supernatants were collected to assay LDH activity. The absorbances of all samples were measured at 490 nm on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Morphological changes in MCF-7 cells Cells were washed twice with PBS and then stained with 5 ?mol/L Hoechst 33342 in 1�PBS solution for 10 min at room temperature. The cell morphology was examined using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl ZeissG�ttingen, Germany), and the apoptotic cells were defined by chromatin condensation and fragmentation of nuclei. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cells After the treatment with bornyl caffeate, the cells (1�106) were freshly harvested and suspended in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of PBS and 0.2 mol/L Na2HPO4-0.1 mol/L citric acid (pH 7.5). Following fixation with ice-cold ethanol at 4 �C for 1 h, the cells were resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer and then incubated in a buffer containing 200 ng/mL Annexin V-FITC conjugates at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, the cells were stained with PI (300 ng/mL) for 10 min, and the stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). ROS Determination The intracellular ROS level was measured based on the ROS-induced formation of the highly fluorescent product 2?,7?-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) from the non-fluorescent dye 2?,7?-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), as previously described47,48. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 2�105 cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 �C. Following treatment with bornyl caffeate (0, 10, 25, or 50 ?mol/L), the cells were loaded with 20 ?mol/L 2?,7?-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) in serum-free DMEM medium for 30 min at 37 �C. After the removal of excessive DCFH-DA, the cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Visualization of mitochondrial membrane potential The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed using 5,5?,6,6?-tetrachloro-1,1?,3,3?-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as previously described49. The cells were cultured in 24-well plates. After a 24-h treatment with bornyl caffeate, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 �C with 1 ?g/mL of JC-1 in growth medium. MMP depolarization was visualized by measuring fluorescence at the emission wavelengths of 530 nm and 590 nm after excitement at a wavelength of 485 nm with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, G�ttingen, Germany). Western blotting analysis The cellular proteins were extracted and analyzed for protein expression as previously described47,50. Briefly, 30 ?g of cellular proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Following a 1-h incubation in fresh TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% skimmed milk powder, the blots were probed with specific antibodies including rabbit anti-Akt, anti-ERK, anti-p38, anti-JNK, anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-GAPDH, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-cleaved PARP. The bound primary antibodies were detected using a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate. The activity of peroxidase on the blot was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). To characterize the effects of the antioxidants on the bornyl caffeate-induced activation of MAP kinases, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 1 mmol/L of different antioxidants, except for vitamin C (100 ?mol/L), for 1 h, and this was followed by treatment with bornyl caffeate (50 ?mol/L) for 24 h. The intracellular proteins were extracted and analyzed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Statistical analysis The data are presented as the mean�SD for three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed, paired Student's t-test, and a P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results Synthesis and cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate Bornyl caffeate was recently synthesized by exhaustive esterification of caffeic acid with borneol as described (Figure 1)45. The cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate was evaluated by the standard colorimetric MTT assay in MCF-7 cells, which served as a cell model of human breast cancer46. Following the exposure to bornyl caffeate at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L for 24 h or at a concentration of 50 ?mol/L for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, cell viability was assayed based on the reduction of MTT by mitochondrial reductase in viable cells. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, bornyl caffeate reduced the cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In similar experiments, caffeic acid and borneol showed no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 50 ?mol/L after 24 h (data not shown). Bornyl caffeate was also found to be cytotoxic in other cancer cells such as HepG2, Hela, T47D, and PC12 (Figure S1). The cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate was also verified by measuring LDH release. As shown in Figure 2C and 2D, the LDH activity in the medium was increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Typically, bornyl caffeate at a concentration of 50 ?mol/L significantly induced the release of the LDH enzyme after a 6-h incubation. These results suggest that bornyl caffeate may be a potential cytotoxic reagent for cancer cells. Bornyl caffeate induced apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells To characterize the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate, we treated MCF-7 cells with the compound at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L for 24 h. We first examined the nuclear morphology of MCF-7 cells by staining with Hoechst 33342. Upon exposure to bornyl caffeate, the incorporation of fluorescent dye was increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3A), and it was clear that bornyl caffeate induced the formation of condensed and fragmented cell nuclei (see arrows). Secondly, we detected the appearance of the early apoptosis biomarker phospho-serine at the cell surface by Annexin V-FITC staining. As shown in Figure 3B, bornyl caffeate increased the number of Annexin V-FITC-positive cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Due to the loss of cell-membrane integrity, the incorporation of the fluorescent dye PI was similarly increased. Thirdly, we investigated the effect of bornyl caffeate on the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using a cationic fluorescent probe JC-1. JC-1 is preferably incorporated into the mitochondrion of viable cells, giving rise to a maximal fluorescence emission at ?590 nm (red), whereas the maximal fluorescence emission of JC-1 in the cytosol appears at ?525 nm (green). By measuring such a shift in the fluorescence emission by fluorescence microscopy, mitochondrial polarization was readily detected in bornyl caffeate-treated cells (Figure 3C). Notably, in the cells exposed to 50 ?mol/L of bornyl caffeate, a significant amount of the fluorescent dye JC-1 was present in the cytosol rather than the mitochondria (see arrows). Bornyl caffeate stimulates ROS formation To clarify the effect of bornyl caffeate on the intracellular redox status, we determined the intracellular ROS level by measuring the oxidation of non-fluorescent DCFH-DA to its highly fluorescent derivative 2?,7?-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). As shown in Figure 3D, bornyl caffeate stimulated ROS formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Effect of bornyl caffeate on apoptosis biomarkers To verify the induction of apoptosis by bornyl caffeate, we investigated the effect of bornyl caffeate on the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. We found that bornyl caffeate up-regulated the intracellular level of Bax but down-regulated the intracellular level of Bcl-xL in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4A and 4B). The expression of Bcl-2 was not dramatically affected even when the drug concentration was increased as high as 50 ?mol/L. We further clarified if bornyl caffeate could trigger the activation of the caspase cascade by monitoring the cleavage of caspase-3 and its action on PARP. As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, bornyl caffeate at concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 ?mol/L triggered the cleavage of caspase-3. Importantly, upon activation, caspase-3 subsequently degraded PARP, giving rise to a reduction in the intracellular PARP level in a concentration-dependent manner. Bornyl caffeate persistently activates the MAP kinases JNK and p38 To explore the mechanisms modulating the induction of apoptosis, we investigated the effect of bornyl caffeate on different protein kinases. MCF-7 cells were treated with bornyl caffeate (50 ?mol/L) for various periods (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h). At the end of treatment, the cellular proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, two pro-survival kinases, Akt and ERK, were marginally activated at the early stage (0.5�3 h); however, the phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK signals were gradually reduced to basal levels. In contrast, the phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK signals were gradually increased over a period of 12 h. These results stimulated us to further examine if activation of the MAP kinases p38 and JNK was dependent on the concentration of bornyl caffeate. We found that bornyl caffeate at a concentration of 50 ?mol/L induced a dramatic increase in the phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK signals, whereas, at concentrations of 10 and 25 ?mol/L, the phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK signals were barely detectable (data not shown). Antioxidants differentially attenuate the activation of the MAP kinases p38 and JNK To understand how bornyl caffeate activated the MAP kinases p38 and JNK, we focused on the potential role of intracellular ROS. We employed four common antioxidants, NAC, GSH, vitamin C, and Trolox, to scavenge intracellular ROS. By detecting phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK in cells that were treated with bornyl caffeate and antioxidants, alone or in combination, we found that antioxidants differentially affected the activation of p38 and JNK by bornyl caffeate. In particular, antioxidants effectively antagonized the effect of bornyl caffeate on the activation of p38 but showed little activity against the activation of JNK (Figure 5C). Characterization of the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate To explore the mechanisms by which bornyl caffeate induced apoptosis, we first investigated the effect of protein kinase inhibitors on the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. As shown in Figure 6A, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate, whereas neither the ERK inhibitor PD98059 nor the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 showed any effect. These results suggest that activation of the MAP kinases p38 and JNK plays a role in the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. Second, we investigated the effect of different antioxidants on the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. To our surprise, all of these antioxidants, except for the thiol antioxidant L-NAC, failed to protect the cells against the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate (Figure 6). Third, we investigated the effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD on the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. As shown in Figure 6C, inhibition of caspases by z-VAD resulted in partial protection of the cells against the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. Taken together, the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate can be partially attenuated by scavenging ROS and inhibiting MAP kinases and the caspase cascade. Discussion In the present study, we investigated the anticancer mechanisms of bornyl caffeate in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. By assaying the effect of bornyl caffeate on the reduction of MTT in viable cells and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from dead cells, we found that bornyl caffeate exhibited strong cytotoxicity in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2). To explore the underlying mechanisms for this process, we further characterized the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate by examining the morphological changes of cell nuclei and the presentation of the early apoptotic marker phosphoserine at the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, bornyl caffeate increased the shrinkage of cell nuclei and staining of Annexin V-FITC in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting an apoptotic mechanism. These apoptotic features were supported by an increase in the protein level of pro-apoptotic Bax and a decrease in the intracellular level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl (Figure 4A). In line with the increase in the expression of the mitochondria-damaging protein Bax, bornyl caffeate actually disrupted the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane and induced the activation of caspase-3 (Figure 3C and 4C). These results stimulate us to postulate that the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate is mediated by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Induction of apoptosis is a major anticancer mechanism for a variety of cancer therapies3. Caffeate derivatives such as CAPE and octylcaffeate have been previously demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines and animal models43,51. The common caffeate group in these compounds is presumably the key structural element responsible for inducing apoptosis. Bornyl caffeate is a combination of two well-known, anti-inflammatory chemical elements, caffeate and borneol, which renders this compound a potential anticancer drug candidate. Our results provided experimental evidence that support the potential of bornyl caffeate in inducing apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. We also observed similar cytotoxicity in several other cancer cell lines such as hepatoma HepG2, cervical cancer HeLa and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (Figure S1). Drug-induced apoptosis of cancer cells is ultimately executed by the caspase cascade, especially through caspase 3/6/752,53. However, various anticancer drugs, irradiation and Fas ligand may induce apoptosis through different mechanisms4,54."

Here, we have used a mouse tumor model that closely recapitulates this human disease to illustrate that adult lung cells are uniquely sensitive to transformation by this oncogene. Monitoring lung cells at the single-cell level revealed that they respond differently to K-Ras oncogenic signals. Whereas K-Ras�expressing Clara cells required an inflammatory response to yield hyperplasias and adenomas, alveolar type II cells or their committed precursors led to the generation of malignant adenocarcinoma regardless of their surrounding microenvironment. Ubiquitous expression of a resident K-RasG12V oncogene in adult mice revealed that most tissues are resistant to K-Ras oncogenic signals. Indeed, K-RasG12V expression only induced overt tumors in lungs. To identify these transformation-permissive cells, we induced K-RasG12V expression in a very limited number of adult lung cells (0.2%) and monitored their fate by X-Gal staining, a surrogate marker coexpressed with the K-RasG12V oncoprotein. Four weeks later, 30% of these cells had proliferated to form small clusters. However, only SPC+ alveolar type II (ATII) cells were able to form hyperplastic lesions, some of which progressed to adenomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast, induction of K-RasG12V expression in lung cells by intratracheal infection with adenoviral-Cre particles generated hyperplasias in all regions except the proximal airways. Bronchiolar and bronchioalveolar duct junction hyperplasias were primarily made of CC10+ Clara cells. Some of them progressed to form benign adenomas. However, only alveolar hyperplasias, exclusively made up of SPC+ ATII cells, progressed to yield malignant adenocarcinomas. Adenoviral infection induced inflammatory infiltrates primarily made of T and B cells. This inflammatory response was essential for the development of K-RasG12V�driven bronchiolar hyperplasias and adenomas, but not for the generation of SPC+ ATII lesions. Finally, activation of K-RasG12V during embryonic development under the control of a Sca1 promoter yielded CC10+, but not SPC+, hyperplasias, and adenomas. These results, taken together, illustrate that different types of lung cells can generate benign lesions in response to K-Ras oncogenic signals. However, in adult mice, only SPC+ ATII cells were able to yield malignant adenocarcinomas. inflammation genetically engineered mouse model non-small cell lung cancer lung stem cells J Clin Oncol J.

The data warehouse assembled to guide the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 was used. Methods Data from 13 trials (5,480 patients with metastatic breast cancer, non�small-cell lung cancer, or colorectal cancer) were randomly split (60:40) into training and validation data sets. In all, 27 pairs of cut points for PR and PD were considered: PR (10% to 50% decrease by 5% increments) and PD (10% to 20% increase by 5% increments), for which 30% and 20% correspond to the RECIST categorization. Cox proportional hazards models with landmark analyses at 12 and 24 weeks stratified by study and number of lesions (fewer than three v three or more) and adjusted for average baseline tumor size were used to assess the impact of each metric on overall survival (OS). Model discrimination was assessed by using the concordance index (c-index). Results Standard RECIST cut points demonstrated predictive ability similar to the alternate PR and PD cut points. Regardless of tumor type, the TriTR, DiTR, and DCR metrics had similar predictive performance. "
Lung_Cancer "The 24-week metrics (albeit with higher c-index point estimate) were not meaningfully better than the 12-week metrics. None of the metrics did particularly well for breast cancer. Conclusion Alternative cut points to RECIST standards provided no meaningful improvement in OS prediction. Metrics assessed at 12 weeks have good predictive performance.

Introduction: Detection of the ALK rearrangement in a solid tumor gives these patients the option of crizotinib as an oral form of anticancer treatment. The current test of choice is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but various cheaper and more convenient immunohistochemical (IHC) assays have been proposed as alternatives. Methods: Fifteen FISH-positive cases from patients, seven with data on crizotinib therapy and clinical response, were evaluated for the presence of ALK protein using three different commercially available antibodies: D5F3, using the proprietary automated system (Ventana), ALK1 (Dako), and 5A4 (Abcam). A further 14 FISH-negative and three uncertain (<15% rearrangement detected) cases were also retrieved. Of the total 32 specimens, 17 were excisions and 15 were computed tomography-guided biopsies or cytological specimens. All three antibodies were applied to all cases. Antibodies were semiquantitatively scored on intensity, and the proportion of malignant cells stained was documented. Cutoffs were set by receiver operating curve analysis for positivity to optimize correct classification. Results: All three IHC assays were 100% specific but sensitivity did vary: D5F3 86%, ALK 79%, 5A4 71%. Intensity was the most discriminating measure overall, with a combination of proportion and intensity not improving the test. No FISH-negative IHC-positive cases were seen. Two FISH-positive cases were negative with all three IHC assays. One of these had been treated with crizotinib and had failed to show clinical response. The other harbored a second driving mutation in the EGFR gene. Conclusions: IHC with all three antibodies is especially highly specific (100%) although variably sensitive (71%-86%), specifically in cases with scanty material. D5F3 assay was most sensitive in these latter cases. Occasional cases are IHC-positive but FISH-negative, suggesting either inaccuracy of one assay or occasional tumors with ALK rearrangement that do not express high levels of ALK protein. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma ALK Immunohistochemistry Fluorescence in situ hybridization Crizotinib OPEN-ACCESS TRUE Rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene drive the malignant phenotype in 3% to 7% of primary lung adenocarcinomas.1�5 The resulting fusion protein, most often a fusion with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (ELM4), has a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain. The small molecule drug crizotinib is a specific inhibitor of this kinase,6 and cases with the rearrangement respond to crizotinib treatment.7 Therefore, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive identification of tumors growing under the influence of translocated ALK is needed. Currently the only test approved by the FDA is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using �break-apart� probes (Vysis, Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL). This test is regarded as the �gold standard� for detection of re-arrangements and is recommended by CAP/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/AMP.8 However, FISH is technically demanding, expensive, and many diagnostic laboratories lack either the expertise or the facilities to perform the test. Even in ideal circumstances, the results are often difficult to interpret, requiring the scrutiny of large numbers of individual cells by a highly experienced diagnostician. Furthermore, there are rare circumstances (such as small intrachromosomal inversion) in which the FISH test is negative but the tumor nevertheless expresses EML4-ALK fusion protein.5,9�11 A cheaper and potentially more widely applicable method is immunohistochemistry (IHC); indeed, overexpression of ALK protein has been used in the diagnosis of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma for many years. Although early studies in lung cancer lacked sensitivity,4,5 more recent studies have shown greater specificity and sensitivity,8�11 and recent international guidelines (CAP/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/AMP) have recommended that, if clinically validated, IHC may be used as a screening test for FISH testing.8 However, there have been few comparative studies on the most appropriate antibody to use. The aim of this study was therefore to compare three different immunohistochemical assays, two being routine methods using antibodies widely used in the diagnosis of lymphoma, with the third being a proprietary system, including signal amplification, that is currently being promoted as an alternative to FISH (Ventana). We also evaluated the relationships between ALK rearrangement as detected by FISH, IHC, and patient response to therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical Samples The diagnostic archives from the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Marsden hospitals from 2007 onwards were reviewed to identify cases with a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that tested positive for an ALK rearrangement (>15% positive cells), and a randomly selected complementary group of cases with a normal ALK locus for comparison. We had been testing all primary lung tumors regardless of stage as part of a feasibility study, which led to a large number of early stage cases being included. More recently, our current policy is only to test advanced cases of non-squamous non�small-cell carcinoma using IHC screening with confirmatory FISH as per recently published guidelines.8 The cases under study are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1. Summary Data of All Cases Included in the Study Paraffin blocks from a total of 32 diagnostic cases were retrieved; 15 of these had tested positive for the ALK rearrangement by FISH, three were uncertain (with <15% of cells showing rearrangement), and the remaining 14 cases were negative. All but two blocks dated from 2011 or later. Seventeen cases were blocks from tumor excisions (six of these were FISH positive) and the remainder were cytological or core biopsy/endobronchial ultrasound samples. Data on treatment with crizotinib and response were retrieved from patient records. Cases with at least partial response to treatment defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria12 (i.e., at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions) were designated as �responsive�. The study was evaluated and classified as a service evaluation by the Imperial College Heads of Consortia and as such was exempt from Research Ethics Committee review. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization Unstained 2 ?m FFPE sections were put through deparaffinization and protease pretreatment steps before being denatured and hybridized overnight with the commercially available Vysis ALK dual color break apart probe (Abbott Molecular). Tissue sections then underwent SSC washes and were mounted in 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclei counterstaining. Results were analyzed and interpreted in accordance with probe manufacturer�s instructions. Non-rearranged ALK showed as fused (yellow) signals. Rearranged ALK appeared as split 3? (red) and 5? (green) signals or an isolated 3? (red) signal. The recommended cutoff of 15% was used to interpret samples as positive or negative for ALK rearrangements in 200 nuclei. Immunohistochemistry An additional five sections were cut per case. Three were used for the immunohistochemical assays and the remaining two for negative controls. Immunohistochemical assays were optimized using the monoclonal antibodies D5F3 (Ventana), ALK1 (Dako) and 5A4 (Abcam). The D5F3 assay was performed using the Ventana autostainer and a tyramide amplification step, as specified in the manufacturer�s protocol. The other assays were performed using a Dako autostainer with conventional polymer-based diaminobenzidine staining (no tyramide amplification). Details of the antibodies and conditions employed are given in Table 2. TABLE 2. Immunohistochemical Assay Conditions Used Scoring Immunohistochemically stained sections were examined without knowledge of FISH status by two pathologists independently. Scores for proportion and intensity of immunohistochemical staining were assigned by consensus. The predominant intensity of staining was recorded on a scale of 0�3 (0 = negative, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong). As the Ventana stain was more intense, due at least partly to the signal amplification step, the visual cutoffs for intensity scoring with this antibody were different (e.g., a �moderate� degree of intensity seen with the Ventana stain would usually be interpreted as �strong� on a section stained with 5A4). The proportion of malignant cells staining positive was recorded as per �Allred� estrogen receptor scoring in breast cancer, on a scale of 0�5 (0 = 0%, 1 ? 1%, 2 = 1�10%, 3 = 11�33%, 4 = 34�66% and 5 ? 66%). A composite score (intensity + proportion) was also derived. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the STATA/IC package. RESULTS Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Slides were scored according to the manufacturer�s recommendations. Representative FISH images are shown in Figure 1A. The 15 positive cases all showed greater than 15% cells with rearranged ALK genes. Three cases were classified as �indeterminate�; these were all scanty biopsy or cytological samples with 10% to 15% of positively rearranged FISH signals. Seventeen further cases were FISH negative. FIGURE 1. (A) Representative fluorescence in situ hybridization images showing normal fused signals (neg) and nuclei with multiple separated red signals (pos). (B) Three representative excision specimens of adenocarcinoma. Case 1 is negative with all three immunohistochemical assays; the D5F3 assay shows relatively high background, presumably because of the tyramide signal amplification (TSA) step. Cases 2 and 3 are positive with all three immunohistochemical assays, with clear cytoplasmic staining. The markedly reduced signal seen with the 5A4 and ALK1 assays in case 2 was typical and again probably related to the absence of tyramide amplification. Case 3 demonstrates that occasional cases show strong staining using the non-TSA assays. Immunohistochemistry No signal was observed in negative controls. The intensity of staining between the three antibodies varied (Fig. 1B). IHC was impossible to assess in three cases with very scanty material (two FISH negative and one FISH positive). "
Lung_Cancer "The Ventana assay using the D5F3 antibody gave the most intense cytoplasmic signal, but this was accompanied by higher background staining, which was especially noticeable in macrophages. The ALK1 and 5A4 antibody assays produced weaker staining but with less background. Of the two, 5A4 had marginally more background staining, especially in macrophages. The value of both intensity and proportion scores was assessed. Cutoffs for positivity were set using ROC analysis to optimize correct classification of ALK status, using FISH results as the standard (Table 3). The intensity score alone was seen to outperform both proportion and the aggregate score. Therefore intensity scoring using the optimized cutoff was used in subsequent analyses. TABLE 3. Optimised Cutoff Values for Immunohistochemical Tests Concordance between FISH and IHC is shown in Table 4. No cases with negative FISH results and positive IHC were identified (100% specificity of IHC in these data). Sensitivity was the same (83%) for all three assays in excision specimens. In small biopsies and cytological specimens, however, the D5F3 antibody was the most sensitive. The ALK1 and 5A4 assays failed to identify a further one or two FISH-positive cases, respectively. All three assays failed to stain the same two cases which contain rearranged ALK genes detectable by FISH. TABLE 4. Concordance of Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Assays Response to Therapy Seven cases with ALK rearrangements detected by FISH went on to receive crizotinib therapy. All but one showed at least a partial response. This crizotinib-refractory case showed no detectable ALK expression by all three IHC assays. DISCUSSION We have compared three different antibody assays for the ALK kinase domain to the current standard FISH assay in a set of archival tumors, including 15 FISH-positive cases. We found all three assays to be specific (100%) and sensitive (up to 86%), especially when a signal amplification technique is employed. Furthermore, data on response to crizotinib therapy in seven treated cases showed all but one case responded. The case that failed to respond to therapy was negative by all three IHC assays. Of the three antibody methods compared, the D5F3 antibody using a Ventana proprietary assay performed the best, especially in scanty samples, which is likely to be a consequence of the tyramide signal amplification step incorporated into the Ventana assay. It is possible that the other two antibodies would perform as well, if a suitable signal amplification step were introduced. However, an assay using the 5A4 without tyramide amplification has been successfully applied by To et al in a recent comparable assessment of IHC as a test for ALK rearrangement.5 In a set of 373 tumors that included 20 ALK rearrangements as detected by FISH, their IHC assay was 99% specific and 100% sensitive. In contrast to this, we find 100% specificity and (at best) 86% sensitivity; that is to say, we identified rare FISH-positive IHC-negative cases, whereas To et al found occasional FISH-negative IHC-positive cases, which were proved to harbor EML4-ALK rearrangements by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).5 It is unsurprising that we do not identify FISH-negative IHC-positive cases as we only examined 17 FISH-negative or indeterminate cases in comparison to the 356 examined by To et al.5 It is more notable that To et al.5 do not identify FISH-positive, IHC-negative cases. This might be explained by their use of tissue microarrays for FISH, which is even more technically demanding and hard to interpret than FISH using whole sections. This possible shortcoming of tissue microarray methods might be apparent in two other recent studies using tissue microarrays for a comparison of FISH with ALK1, 5A4 and D5F3 antibodies.13,14 Selinger et al.13 describe 100% sensitivity for all three antibody assays. Conklin et al.14 also find 100% sensitivity and a maximum specificity of 88% (again using the 5A4 antibody). Again, it may be that in both these additional studies the approach used hampered the identification of FISH-positive, IHC-negative cases because of the difficulty of applying FISH to TMAs, especially when the primary test has been IHC and the FISH test is not �blind� to the IHC result. Other recent studies compare various immunohistochemical assays and FISH for the detection of ALK rearrangements.15,16 As in this study, Sholl et al.15 identify occasional FISH-positive, IHC-negative cases. They explain two cases by identifying co-existent mutations in other driving oncogenes (presumably thereby relieving the tumor �addiction� to ALK) and one by insufficient tumor material for accurate IHC assessment. Savic et al.16 compared an immunocytochemical assay using the 5A4 antibody to FISH in cytological specimens and achieved a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 96%, which is comparable with our findings in cytological and small biopsy cases (sensitivity 88%, specificity 100%). In the current study, we detected two �false-negative� cases, which were positive by FISH and negative by all three IHC assays. This combination has two possible explanations. Firstly, they might represent tumors which are not expressing ALK protein at detectable levels, because of a false-positive FISH result, or an absence of addiction to rearranged ALK protein despite presence of recombined ALK DNA. These tumors are unlikely to respond to crizotinib. Secondly, they might represent a failure of the IHC assay, because of poor preservation of antigen, insufficient material or another technical error. In this case, crizotinib therapy would still be likely to be effective. The study includes seven cases with positive FISH results with data on response to crizotinib. Six showed at least a partial response to crizotinib therapy, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. A single case showed no response, and this was one of the two �false negatives�. Thus, in this one case, the IHC test would have correctly predicted response. This was a scanty cytological specimen in which FISH interpretation was difficult, and only 20% of 515 cells showed rearranged ALK signals (fusion plus split red/green probes and fusion plus isolated red signal). Therefore, it seems possible that this represents a technical failure of the FISH assay. The other case, an excision specimen, showed 39% of 626 cells with rearranged signals. It was also shown to harbor a driving mutation in a second gene; PCR testing demonstrated the loss of exon 19 of endothelial growth factor receptor. This has been described in another study that characterized two such �false-negative� cases.15 Thus, these tumors may well escape �oncogene addiction� to the ALK kinase activity, which would be consistent with indetectable ALK protein expression. Again, IHC would be expected to be the best predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in such cases. It is essential to identify and molecularly characterize other �false-negative� cases that have received crizotinib therapy. In addition, it seems likely that IHC should guide treatments in �false-positive� cases that express high levels of ALK from genetic lesions that are invisible to the current FISH assay. Although we identified no �false positives�, i.e., FISH-negative, IHC-positive cases, our sensitivity may be an overestimate (as judged by FISH) because of the small number of FISH-negative cases under study. Several studies have identified rare cases with rearrangements that are indetectable by FISH but detectable by IHC and confirmed by reverse-transcriptase PCR.5,9,10 Such cases would be expected to respond to crizotinib, and a recent study shows that at least one novel �FISH-indetectable� rearrangement does indeed drive the malignant phenotype.5"
Lung_Cancer "One limitation of this study is the small number of cases under study, although 15 FISH-positive cases is comparable to most other studies. The relatively small number of FISH-negative cases may have affected our ability to identify FISH-negative, IHC-positive cases. However, the study design does permit an assessment of the sensitivity of the IHC assay, which is the most important consideration for a possible screening test. Our comparison of the immunohistochemical assays was not directly equivalent, as the D5F3 assay included a proprietary tyramide signal amplification step, whereas the ALK1 and 5A4 assays were conducted using our routine diagnostic detection system. However, our study design also has several strengths. In particular, the use of archival diagnostic paraffin blocks, and FISH testing conducted in the course of routine diagnosis make the results of the study directly relevant to clinical practice. In summary, we find IHC to be a highly sensitive (86%) and specific (100%) test for ALK rearrangement in lung adenocarcinoma. We find a slight advantage of a proprietary amplified assay (D5F3 Ventana) over two other antibodies with conventional DAB staining (ALK1 Dako and 5A4 Abcam), but only in scanty samples. Intensity of staining was the most discriminating measure, and the proportion of cells staining did not contribute. We identified two cases that were positive for the ALK rearrangement by FISH but negative by all immunohistochemical assays and suggest that in discordant cases the IHC test result may be more predictive of treatment response than FISH. Further discordant cases need to be examined to help guide the treatment of these cases. Immunohistochemical testing is clearly at least a useful adjunct to FISH, and we feel that it is reasonable in routine practice to use a sensitive IHC assay as a screening test. The danger of missing treatable cases using this method (i.e., FISH-positive, IHC-negative, crizotinib-sensitive tumors) appears very small, especially when specimens contain adequate material. In difficult cases, further investigations such as re-biopsy and repeated IHC/FISH may be helpful.

To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ Background: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: This single arm, multicentre phase II trial enrolled patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients received intravenous ziv-aflibercept 6?mg?kg?1, pemetrexed 500?mg?m?2, and cisplatin 75?mg?m?2, every 21 days for up to six cycles. Maintenance administration of ziv-aflibercept was to continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or other cause for withdrawal. The co-primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Planned sample size was 72 patients. Results: The study was closed prematurely because of three confirmed and two suspected cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). A total of 42 patients were enrolled. Median age was 61.5 years;"
Lung_Cancer "55% were male, 86% Caucasian and 50% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)=0. A median of four cycles of ziv-aflibercept was administered. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were nausea (69%) and fatigue (67%), with hypertension (36%) as the most common grade 3/4 TEAE. Of the 38 evaluable patients, ORR was 26% and median PFS was 5 months. Conclusion: Cases of RPLS had been observed in other studies in the ziv-aflibercept clinical development programme but the rate observed in this study was higher than previously observed. This might be related to declining renal function and/or hypertension. Although ORR and PFS were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies, this combination of ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/pemetrexed will not be further explored in NSCLC. ziv-aflibercept non-small cell lung cancer reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome anti-angiogenesis Cancer growth is dependent upon angiogenesis to maintain a source of nutrition and oxygen (Folkman, 1995), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a key role in tumour angiogenesis (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, 1997). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) produces VEGF, and high serum levels of VEGF are correlated with poor prognosis (Korpanty et al, 2010). Anti-angiogenic therapy thus aims to disrupt blood supply to tumours and has proven clinical benefit in non-squamous NSCLC (Jain, 2001). Combination chemotherapy is used for the first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (Schiller et al, 2002). The addition of the anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, to carboplatin/paclitaxel in this setting improved response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS; Sandler et al, 2006). Similarly, bevacizumab improved PFS when added to cisplatin/gemcitabine, although OS was not significantly prolonged as a secondary end point in this case (Reck et al, 2009). For non-squamous histology, cisplatin/pemetrexed is a very active combination chemotherapy (Scagliotti et al, 2008), and thus combinations of platinum/pemetrexed with bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenics are of strong interest for the first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC (Patel et al, 2009b). Ziv-aflibercept (ZALTRAP, Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, USA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, USA) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Gaya and Tse, 2012). Ziv-aflibercept binds VEGF-A by acting as a high-affinity ligand trap to prevent binding to its endogenous receptor VEGFR-2, thereby inhibiting VEGF-induced angiogenesis in preclinical models (Lassoued et al, 2010). Endothelial cells expressing high levels of VEGFR-2 were highly susceptible to blockade by ziv-aflibercept (Sitohy et al, 2011). In addition, ziv-aflibercept binds PIGF (placental growth factor) and VEGF-B, which could potentially inhibit cancer invasion (Dowlati, 2010). Studies have investigated ziv-aflibercept as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of various types of cancers (Lockhart et al, 2010; Tew et al, 2010; de Groot et al, 2011; Isambert et al, 2012). In August 2012, ziv-aflibercept was approved by the US FDA for use in metastatic colorectal cancer based on the results of VELOUR trial (Van Cutsem et al, 2012). A phase II study using ziv-aflibercept as monotherapy demonstrated objective responses in heavily pretreated patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung (Leighl et al, 2010), and improvement in response and PFS (but not OS) was observed in combination with docetaxel as second-line treatment of NSCLC (Ramlau et al, 2012). We report the results of a phase II trial of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. This study was conducted after a phase I trial using the same regimen of ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/pemetrexed (Diaz-Padilla et al, 2012). That phase I trial determined the recommended dose of ziv-aflibercept (6?mg?kg?1 every 21 days) to be used in the current phase II trial, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Materials and methods Eligibility Patients eligible for this study had histologically/cytologically confirmed, untreated, locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC, and they had to have measurable disease as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Therasse et al, 2000). Patients with squamous histology and/or cavitating lesions were excluded. Patients were 18 years of age or older, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, with adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic functions and calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) ?60?ml?min?1. Patients were excluded from the study if they had brain or central nervous system metastases; systolic blood pressure (BP) >150?mm?Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >100?mm?Hg; bleeding diathesis or evidence of active bleeding; or recent significant cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic conditions. "
Lung_Cancer "The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each participating institution. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Study design This is a single arm, open label, multicentre phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00794417). Patients received the three-drug combination intravenously on day 1 of every 21 days, with ziv-aflibercept (6?mg?kg?1) first, followed by pemetrexed (500?mg?m?2) and cisplatin (75?mg?m?2). Premedications consisted of folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone as a prophylactic measure to reduce pemetrexed-related toxicities and standard anti-emetics. Patients could receive up to six cycles of combination therapy. For patients who completed the combined chemotherapy, maintenance ziv-aflibercept every 21 days was to continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study. End points and assessments The two co-primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and PFS. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with complete response plus partial response (CR+PR). The PFS was defined as the time interval from the first dose of combination chemotherapy to tumour progression or death, whichever occurred first. Secondary variables were the determination of the adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic profiles (including anti-ziv-aflibercept antibody and hematopoiesis). Pharmacokinetic end points included the area under the concentration curve, maximum concentration (Cmax), clearance, and terminal half-life (t1/2). Tumour imaging (CT or MRI) was performed at screening, on day 21 (�7 days) of every even numbered cycle (every 6 weeks), and when disease progression was suspected. Responses were assessed using RECIST, version 1.0 (Therasse et al, 2000). Safety and tolerability were assessed at baseline and at least every 21 days, as evaluated by AEs and changes in laboratory parameters graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0 (National Cancer Institute, 2006). Ziv-aflibercept (free or bound to VEGF) in plasma samples was quantified using a validated, direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A validated, non-quantitative, titre-based, bridging assay was used to detect anti-ziv-aflibercept antibodies in serum samples. Correlative studies The exploratory objective of the correlative studies was to evaluate changes in erythropoiesis in response to VEGF inhibition. It was hypothesised that VEGF inhibition would result in an increase in haemoglobin via increased hepatic erythropoietin production. Statistical analysis Statistical testing was done to determine whether the ORR was larger than 20% or whether the PFS was greater than 4.5 months. Exact test (one-sided) was used to test the null hypothesis that ORR was ?20% versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR was ?35%. Assuming type I error was not >2.5%, a sample of 72 patients would provide >80% power to test the hypothesis using exact binomial test. The calculated sample size of 72 patients would also provide >90% power to test the null hypothesis that median PFS was ?4.5 months versus the alternative hypothesis that PFS was ?6.5 months at one-sided alpha of 2.5% using one sample log-rank test. Safety data were to be summarised. Concentrations of free ziv-aflibercept and adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept: VEGF complex were to be summarised every 21 days over the duration of the study by nominal time point. Noncompartmental parameters were calculated using WinNonlin (version 5.3, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA) and model 202 (constant infusion) using nominal time points after a single dose of ziv-aflibercept. The noncompartmental analysis was performed over the dosing interval, 21 days following the first dose. All analyses used statistical software SAS (version 9.1.3, Cary, NC, USA). Results Patients This study was closed prematurely because of three confirmed and two suspected but unconfirmed cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). A total of 42 patients were enrolled from 17 participating sites across the United States and Canada between January, 2009 and December, 2010. Table 1 summarises the patient demographics. Median age was 61.5 years; 55% were male, 86% were Caucasian and 50% had ECOG PS of 0. Safety evaluation Treatment exposure and dose modifications All 42 patients received at least one dose of each of the three study drugs, with a median of 92 days of treatment (range 21�288 days). Twenty-seven (64%) patients completed four or more cycles of the combination treatment. A median of 4.5 (range 1�6) cycles of pemetrexed and 4 (range 1�6) cycles of cisplatin were administered. The median dose intensity was 163.9 (range 110.1�175.5)?mg?m?2 per week for pemetrexed and 24.6 (range 15.3�26.3)?mg?m?2 per week for cisplatin. The delivered dose intensities were 98.3% for pemetrexed and 98.5% for cisplatin. Seventeen (40%) completed six or more cycles of ziv-aflibercept. The median dose intensity of ziv-aflibercept was 1.97?mg?kg?1 per week, close to the planned intensity of 2?mg?kg?1 per week. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression (33%), AEs (33%), and others (34%, including withdrawal of consent and investigator request). Seventeen patients had at least one cycle delayed. Eleven patients (26%) had at least 1 dose modification of ziv-aflibercept, 6 (14%) of pemetrexed, and 11 of cisplatin. Adverse events Thirty-five patients (83%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of grade 3 or 4 (3/4), and 16 patients (38%) experienced a serious TEAE. The most common TEAEs were nausea (69%), fatigue (67%), and hypertension (57%). Hypertension, neutropaenia, and hypokalaemia were the most common grade 3/4 TEAEs in 36%, 14%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Table 2 summarised the most common TEAEs. Thirty-nine patients (93%) experienced at least one haematologic abnormality, with grade 3/4 in eight patients (19%), mostly neutropaenia. Every patient experienced at least one abnormal chemistry value, with grade 3/4 in 15 (36%), most commonly hyponatraemia. Seven patients (17%) died before clinical cutoff of the study. Five died due to disease progression and two due to TEAEs: 1 pneumonia and 1 sepsis. Neurological toxicities Between 26 September, 2010 and 30 December, 2010, five patients experienced neurological symptoms, including altered mental status in four, slurred speech in one, seizure in two, and headache in four patients. Three patients had a brain MRI that was consistent with RPLS (Figure 1B). Brain MRI was negative for RPLS in two other patients. The three patients diagnosed with RPLS were all Caucasian women, aged 38, 51, and 72 years, respectively. One of the three patients with RPLS entered the study with a history of hypertension. All three patients experienced elevated BP and two patients had reduced CrCL during the therapy: one patient's CrCL decreased by 45% from baseline (141 to 78?ml?min?1) after one cycle, and the other's decreased by 20% (64 to 51?ml?min?1) after four cycles. They were diagnosed with RPLS after one, two, and five cycles of ziv-aflibercept, respectively. Two patients recovered from RPLS, and one died due to disease progression before RPLS resolution. Pharmacokinetic information was available for two of the three RPLS patients and for one suspected case: systemic concentrations of free ziv-aflibercept were within the range of other patients in the treatment cohort. In the phase I study using the same regimen (N=18), five patients experienced a mild neurocognitive disturbance but no RPLS was diagnosed (Diaz-Padilla et al, 2012). Rare cases of RPLS have been observed in the ziv-aflibercept clinical development programme but the rate observed in this study (3 out of 42=7%) was much higher than previously reported (i.e., 0.5% of 3795 patients treated with ziv-aflibercept as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, ZALTRAP product insert). As a result, this study was permanently closed to enrolment. Patients who remained on study were re-consented with updated safety information regarding RPLS in addition to continued close monitoring."
Lung_Cancer "Hypertension and renal insufficiency are two risk factors for RPLS. Twenty-four patients (57%) experienced hypertension (15 grade 3 but no grade 4) during the study, 15 of whom had a history of hypertension and 12 had taken antihypertensive medications before entering the study. Eight patients with hypertension also experienced proteinuria. Fourteen patients (33%) experienced proteinuria (all grades 1 or 2 except a single grade 3), none of whom had a history of renal disease. Fourteen patients experienced CrCL decreases during treatment, with six patients having CrCL decreases below 60?ml?min?1 after treatment cycle 4. Efficacy evaluation As the study was closed prematurely, there was no statistical power to test the primary hypothesis. Of the 42 patients enrolled, 4 patients discontinued early from the study due to AEs (2), consent withdrawal (1), and investigator decision (1). As they did not have a post-baseline tumour assessment, they were excluded from the efficacy assessment per predefined statistical analysis plan. Of the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, the median PFS was 5 months (95% CI, 4.3�7.1; Figure 1A), and ORR was 26% (95% CI, 12�40%), all of which (10/38) were PR. The disease control rate (PR+stable disease) was 89% (26%+63%). A mean reduction of 20% was observed in average percentage changes over time in tumour burden (sum of largest diameters of target lesions) from baseline. Of the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, 22 (58%) developed hypertension as AE during the study. Seven (7 out of 22=32%) had a PR compared with only three with no hypertension (3 out of 16=18%), suggesting that patients who developed hypertension may have had a higher likelihood of response to this treatment. Correlative studies Participation in the correlative studies was optional. Erythropoietin levels were obtained from 16 patients. No trend towards increase in haemoglobin or change in erythropoietin level was seen over time. Pharmacokinetic and antibody evaluation Twenty-three patients participated in blood sampling for PK analysis. Mean observed noncompartmental PK parameters for free ziv-aflibercept are presented in Table 3. The concentration�time profiles and PK of free ziv-aflibercept and adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept: VEGF were consistent with results in the phase I study (Diaz-Padilla et al, 2012). Mean trough concentrations after the second ziv-aflibercept dose plateaued and remained at ?10?mg?l?1. The mean adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept:VEGF complex Cmax was 7.81?mg?l?1. Trough concentrations plateaued after day 42 and remained constant for the remainder of the study. Two patients had one sample each that was positive in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. One was positive at baseline, but did not have an antibody titre drawn at the end of treatment (EOT) visit. This patient completed all six cycles of combination treatment without dose delay/reduction or grade 3/4 AEs and had stable disease. The other one was negative at baseline but positive at the EOT visit. This patient experienced anaphylaxis 20?minutes after start of the ziv-aflibercept infusion on day 1 of the second cycle. Study drug was permanently withdrawn. This patient had PK parameters and a concentration�time profile different from ADA-negative patients, probably because of the ADA formation. Discussion Ziv-aflibercept has been tested as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC (Leighl et al, 2010; Ramlau et al, 2012). On the basis of activity and safety profile, we conducted the current phase II study to explore the efficacy of ziv-aflibercept in the first-line setting. Similar to ECOG 4599, AVAiL, and PointBreak trials (Sandler et al, 2006; Patel et al, 2009a; Reck et al, 2009), this study was designed to test a three-drug regimen including an anti-angiogenesis agent, in this case ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/pemetrexed. In addition, maintenance therapy with single-agent ziv-aflibercept was intended to prolong the benefits and delay the development of resistance. This approach was first tested in a phase I dose-escalation study that used the same regimen of ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/pemetrexed in 18 patients with advanced solid tumours (Diaz-Padilla et al, 2012). Our study population was representative of patients with advanced NSCLC. Overall, the median ziv-aflibercept dose intensity was similar to the planned intensity. The delivered dose intensities of pemetrexed/cisplatin in this study were over 98%, higher than those in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm (94.8% and 95.0%, respectively) of the phase III trial (Scagliotti et al, 2008). The PK of ziv-aflibercept in this study was characterised as nonlinear and similar to that observed in the phase I study. The mean observed terminal t1/2 was independent of ziv-aflibercept dose. Administration of ziv-aflibercept did not alter pemetrexed PK. Development of ADA was a rare event, leading to reduced drug concentration in one patient who experienced anaphylaxis. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity; however, severe hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Although this study was terminated early, the two co-primary end points, ORR of 26% and median PFS of 5 months, were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies (Schiller et al, 2002; Scagliotti et al, 2008) and slightly less than triplet regimens incorporating another anti-VEGF agent (Sandler et al, 2006; Reck et al, 2009). However, there was no statistical power to test the primary hypothesis that ziv-aflibercept would enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in NSCLC. Biomarkers that can reliably predict the degree of VEGF blockade in vivo are currently not available. Preclinical studies identified increased erythropoietin production and erythropoiesis as a possible surrogate marker of VEGF inhibition, as animal data indicate that stringent VEGF inhibition, including by ziv-aflibercept, modulates erythropoiesis via increased hepatic erythropoietin synthesis (Tam et al, 2006). Bevacizumab has also been associated with increased haemoglobin in NSCLC (Riess et al, 2012) and reduced anaemia (Sher and Wu, 2011). Therefore, this study explored whether the increase in haemoglobin observed previously could be reproduced in the presence of chemotherapy and would correlate with anti-angiogenic activity. No trend towards increase in haemoglobin or change in erythropoietin level was found in a small subset of patients."
Lung_Cancer "However, as in the phase I study, a stabilisation of median haemoglobin values for multiple cycles as well as low rate of all-grade anaemia was observed. The result provides some support for the hypothesis that VEGF is a negative regulator of erythropoiesis, and its inhibitors may have a role in the management of anaemia. The toxicity profile of this trial was consistent with published data on cisplatin plus pemetrexed and with the known effects of ziv-aflibercept with the exception of a higher than anticipated rate of RPLS (Gadgeel, 2012). Hypertension was the third most frequent TEAE and is a known adverse effect of anti-VEGF therapies. However, higher response rate was observed among patients who developed hypertension during the treatment than among those who did not in a post hoc analysis. This observation is consistent with data from ECOG 4599 that suggested improved outcomes associated with bevacizumab in patients developing hypertension on therapy (Dahlberg et al, 2010). Although cases of RPLS have been observed in other ziv-aflibercept studies, the 7% rate observed in this study was much higher. It should be noted that the dose and schedule of ziv-aflibercept in this study at 6?mg?kg?1 every 21 days is different from the one approved in colorectal cancer at 4?mg?kg?1 every 14 days (Van Cutsem et al, 2012), although the dose intensity is the same at 2?mg?kg?1 per week. At the recommended phase II dose of 6?mg?kg?1 for ziv-aflibercept, no RPLS was reported in the phase I study that used the same regimen (N=7 at that dose level; Diaz-Padilla et al, 2012), or in another phase I study of ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/docetaxel (N=17 at that dose level; Freyer et al, 2012), nor in combination with docetaxel in the VITAL study (N=456 in the combination arm; Ramlau et al, 2012). A meta-analysis of safety data from three large placebo-controlled studies reported no RPLS among 1333 patients treated with ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard chemotherapy (Allegra et al, 2012). It is likely that the development of RPLS may be regimen dependent rather than dose or schedule dependent. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is described as a brain-capillary leak syndrome frequently related to hypertension, fluid retention, and possibly the cytotoxic effects of immunosuppressive agents on the vascular endothelium (Hinchey et al, 1996). Risk factors include female sex, hypertension, and renal dysfunction (Vaughn et al, 2008), as well as anticancer agents: 75% were diagnosed in women and 71% were associated with combination regimens (Marinella and Markert, 2009). Bevacizumab and gemcitabine have been most commonly associated with RPLS. Treatment including cisplatin without concomitant anti-VEGF therapy has been associated with RPLS (Ito et al, 1998), whereas pemetrexed, before this study, was not. Consistent with the literature, the three cases of RPLS were all diagnosed in women, which may be related to an anticancer drug�oestrogen interaction inducing altered cerebral vasoreactivity and endothelial dysfunction. Agents that decrease VEGF signalling increases the risk of RPLS (including bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, and ziv-aflibercept), suggesting a class effect toxicity (Glusker et al, 2006). Clinical features of RPLS are neurological symptoms characterized by headaches, altered mental status, visual disturbances, or seizures, and systemic signs such as hypertension. Onset is variable ranging from hours to 1 month after completing therapy (Lee et al, 2008). Characteristic findings in brain MRI demonstrate bilateral, symmetric parieto-occipital subcortical and cortical vasogenic oedema (Bartynski, 2008). Removal of the causative agent and treatment of hypertension and renal insufficiency are indicated for RPLS, which is usually, but not always, reversible clinically. In conclusion, this phase II study was designed to evaluate ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with untreated, advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. However, three confirmed and two suspected but unconfirmed cases of RPLS led to the early termination of the trial. The reason for the increased incidence of RPLS might be related to declining CrCL and/or increased BP. Although ORR and median PFS were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies, this combination of ziv-aflibercept/cisplatin/pemetrexed will not be further pursued in NSCLC. Future efforts to identify predictive biomarkers of anti-VEGF agents are warranted. This study was supported by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

Lung_Cancer " Despite previous investigations, it remains unclear how p120-catenin (p120ctn) isoforms 1A and 3A affect the EMT of tumor cells. Here we investigated expression of p120ctn, E-cadherin and vimentin in 78 human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples by immunohistochemistry and found that p120ctn membrane expression positively correlated with E-cadherin expression (P<0.001) and negatively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). Meanwhile, p120ctn cytoplasmic expression negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression (P<0.001) and positively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). Cells expressing high (H460 and SPC) and low (H1299 and LK2) levels of p120ctn were screen to investigate its impact on EMT. E-cadherin was restricted to the cell membrane in H460 and H1299 cells, whereas it was expressed in the cytoplasm of SPC and LK2 cells. Ablation of endogenous p120ctn isoform 1A in cells expressing high levels of the protein resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression, increased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and enhanced invasiveness in H460 cells. Meanwhile, completely opposite results were observed in SPC cells. Furthermore, transfection of in H1299 cells expressing low p120ctn levels with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid resulted in increased E-cadherin expression, decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and weakened invasiveness, while LK2 cells showed completely opposite results. Both cell lines expressing low p120ctn levels and transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid appeared to have increased E-cadherin expression, decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and weakened invasiveness. In conclusion, in cells with membrane E-cadherin, both p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A inhibited EMT and decreased cell invasiveness. In cells with cytoplasmic E-cadherin, p120ctn isoform 1A promoted EMT and increased cell invasiveness, while p120ctn isoform 3A inhibited the EMT and decreased cell invasiveness.

Introduction The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a rapid and often reversible change of cell phenotype and plays a particularly important role in tumor development. In the process of EMT, epithelial cells undergo a phenotypic switch to form mesenchymal cells that are similar in appearance to fibroblasts [1], [2]. Such phenotypic changes cause epithelial cells to lose their characteristic cell-cell adhesion structures, alter their polarity, modulate the organization of their cytoskeletal systems, switch expression from keratin- to vimentin-type intermediate filaments, as well as become isolated, motile and resistant to anoikis [3], [4]. Typically, cells undergoing EMT show decreased E-cadherin expression [5], [6] and decreased expression of mesenchymal biomarkers, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, snail, slug and twist [7], [8]. Previous studies on the relationship between p120-catenin (p120ctn) and EMT have been confined to the switch from short to long p120ctn isoforms during the EMT induced by expression of SIP1/ZEB2 [9], twist [10] or Zeppo1 [11]. However, the mechanism by which p120-catenin isoforms 1A and 3A affect EMT of tumor cells remains unknown. The p120ctn protein has four isoforms (1 to 4) resulting from four transcriptional start sites, and each isoform has a full central Armadillo repeat domain that can interact with the juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin in order to participate in the formation of an adhesion complex on the cell membrane [12]. These observations suggest that the subcellular localization and function of p120ctn can be affected by the localization of E-cadherin. Previous studies have shown that p120ctn may play opposing roles depending on whether it is located on the membrane or in the cytoplasm of cells [13], [14]. Others have also found that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A have different regulatory functions on tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis [15], [16], . These studies indicate that if p120ctn has an impact on the EMT, it is likely to be different between p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A. Some studies have shown that p120ctn may promote or inhibit tumor growth and invasiveness depending on whether E-cadherin expressed or not [18], [19]. Yu and colleagues also found different effects of p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A on proliferation and invasion in tumor cells exhibiting different localizations of E-cadherin [20]. Thus, whether p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A also play different roles in regulating EMT in tumor cells with E-cadherin at different locations remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the potential effects and regulatory mechanisms of p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A on EMT in lung cancer cells. We first revealed that the membrane or cytoplasmic expression of p120ctn correlated with expression of E-cadherin and vimentin or lymph node metastasis by immunohistochemistry. We further detected the expression levels of p120ctn, E-cadherin and vimentin in lung cancer cells by Western blot and screened cell lines expressing both low and high levels of p120ctn and with E-cadherin in the membrane or cytoplasm. Changes in expression of EMT-related molecules and cell invasion were also investigated by knockdown of endogenous p120ctn-1A or overexpression by transfection of p120ctn-1A and 3A plasmids into cells. Materials and Methods Materials This study was conducted with the approval of the institutional review board at China Medical University. Written consent was given by the participants for their information to be stored in the hospital database and for their specimens to be used in this study. All clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Samples were collected from 78 cases of squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University (Sheny-ang, China). The samples were from 46 male and 32 female patients with an average age of 57 years. The samples were classified according to lung tumor histological criteria (2004) of the World Health Organization (WHO) [21] as squamous cell lung carcinoma (32 cases) or lung adeno-carcinoma (46 cases). Thirty cases were highly differentiated, and forty-eight were moderately or poorly differentiated. Lymph node metastases were present in 43 cases, but not in the other 35. We selected cases with lymph node metastases to compare the metastatic nodules with the primary tumor. Tumor staging was performed according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system of the International Union against Cancer (UICC) [22]. There were 39 cases at stage I�II, and 39 cases at stage IIIa�IIIb. None of the patients had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy before the operation and were given the standard treatment following the surgery. All samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for pathological analysis and diagnosis. Cell culture Normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and A549, H1299, H460 and H157 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The SPC-A-1, LTEP-A-2 and LK2 cell lines were purchased from the Shanghai Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Science. The human lung ADC Anip973 and AGZY83a cell lines were purchased from Shanghai Bioleaf Biotech Co., Ltd (http://www.bioleaf.com) and stored in the Department of Pathology, Harbin Medical University. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Plasmid construction and transfection Expression plasmids for p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A (donated by Dr. Albert B. Reynolds Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, TN, USA) have been described previously [16]. Sequences of p120ctn-1A-siRNA (Guangzhou Ruibo Co. Ltd, Guangzhou, China) used in the experiments were as follows: si-h-CTNND1: 5?-CACAAGAUGCCAACCCACU dTdT-3?, 3?-dTdT GUGUUCUACGGUUGGGUGA-5?. The cells were transiently transfected with p120ctn-1A-siRNA and plasmids expressing p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or Attractene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistochemistry The paraffin embedded samples were cut serially into 4-?m thick sections. Normal bronchial epithelium present in the tumor slides was used as an internal positive control."
Lung_Cancer "Immunostaining was performed by the streptavidin-peroxidase (S-P) method. The tissue sections were incubated with a p120ctn mouse monoclonal antibody (1?100, cat. 610134, BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA), E-cadherin rabbit monoclonal antibody (1?100, cat. SC-7870; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or vimentin rabbit monoclonal antibody (ready-to-use, cat. RMA-0547, MaiXin Bio, Fuzhou, China) at 4�C overnight. PBS was used as a negative control. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse serum IgG or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit serum IgG (ready-to-use, cat. KIT-9922, MaiXin Bio) was used as the secondary antibody. After washing, the sections were incubated with streptavidin�biotin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Ultrasensitive, MaiXin Bio), and then the peroxidase reaction was developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (MaiXin Bio). Light counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin, and then the sections were dehydrated in alcohol before being mounted. Two investigators independently examined all the tumor slides. Five random fields were examined per slide, and 100 cells were observed per high magnification field (400�). The percentage of positive cells was scored as follows: 0?=?no staining; 1+?=?0�25%; 2+?=?26�50%; 3+?=?51�75%; and 4+?=?76�100%. The staining intensity was scored as follows: 0?=?no staining; 1?=?light yellow granules; 2?=?dark yellow or brown granules. The labeling score defined by multiplying the percentage of positive cells by the staining intensity was the final score for the section. When the total score was ?3, the case was defined as positive. When the total score was <3, the case was defined as negative. For scores greater than 3 points, when more than 30% of the tumor cells stained strongly and continuously for p120ctn signal on the cell membrane, the sample was defined as membrane positive. When fewer than 30% of the tumor cells displayed membrane expression but stained strongly and continuously for p120ctn in the cytoplasm, the sample was defined as cytoplasm positive. Western blot analysis Fifty micrograms of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). After transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), the proteins were incubated overnight at 4�C with antibodies to the following: p120ctn (1?500, cat. 610134), E-cadherin (1?300, cat. 610181), N-cadherin (1?1000, cat. 610920) (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA), vimentin (1?1000, cat. 5741), snail (1?500, cat. 3879) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) and twist (1?200, cat. sc-15193, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with anti-mouse (1?2000, E030110-01) or anti-rabbit (1?2000, E030120-01) IgG (EarthOx LLC, San Francisco, CA, USA) at 37�C for 2 h, the protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and quantified using BioImaging Systems (UVP, Upland, CA, USA). Relative protein levels were calculated in reference to GAPDH as the loading control. Immunofluorescent staining Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubation with normal goat serum for 30 min at 37�C. Cells were then incubated overnight with p120ctn mouse monoclonal antibody (1?200, cat. 610134; BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA) and E-cadherin rabbit polyclonal antibody (1?100, SC-7870; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4�C, followed by incubation with a rhodamine/fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-mouse or TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1?100, cat. E031210-01 and E031320-01, EarthOx, San Francisco, CA, USA). The nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide/4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylin-dole. Epifluorescent microscopy was performed using an inverted Nikon TE300 microscope (Melville, NY, USA), and confocal microscopy was performed using a Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA). Matrigel cell invasion assay Matrigel cell invasion assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Corning, Acton, MA, USA). A 100-?l cell suspension (5�105 cells) was added to the upper chamber, while the lower chamber was filled with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Each upper and lower chamber was separated by a 8-?m porous polycarbonate membrane. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37�C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. After the medium was discarded, the cells were fixed with methanol for 30 min and stained with hematoxylin (Sigma). For each filter, the numbers of cells that invaded to the lower surface of the porous membrane in five different fields of 400� magnification were counted randomly using a Nikon E200 microscope. The mean was calculated from data obtained from each experiment repeated three times. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows software. The chi-square test was used to analyze immunohistochemistry data. The independent samples T test was used to examine transwell experimental data. P values<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Membrane expression of p120ctn positively correlates with E-cadherin expression and negatively correlates with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis Normal bronchial epithelial tissues showed p120ctn in the membrane (Figure 1A), while the proportion of lung cancer tissues expressing p120ctn in the membrane was significantly lower (35%, 27/78) than that with p120ctn cytoplasmic expression (65%, 51/78). E-cadherin was expressed in the membrane in normal bronchial epithelium tissues (Figure 1A), while the rate of positive expression was decreased (28%, 22/78) and that of negative expression was significantly increased (72%, 56/78) for E-cadherin in lung cancer tissues. Vimentin was negatively expressed in normal bronchial epithelial tissues (Figure 1A), while the rate of positive expression was increased to 32% (25/78) in the lung cancer tissue. It appears lung cancer tissues with cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of p120ctn tended to express vimentin in comparison with those with the membranous localization (41.2% [21/51] versus 14.8 [4/27]).. Cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of p120ctn showed increased lymph node metastasis (29/51) in comparison with the membranous localization (8/27). Statistical analysis showed that the localization of p120ctn was closely related with E-cadherin expression, vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05) (Table 1). In other words, p120ctn membrane expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin expression and negatively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis (Figure 1B); meanwhile, p120ctn cytoplasmic expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression and positively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis (Figure 1C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088064.g001 Figure 1 Immunohistochemical analysis of p120ctn, E-cadherin and vimentin localization in NSCLC.

Although the protein expression levels of p120ctn were not related to E-cadherin, the localization (membrane or cytoplasm) of p120ctn was always consistent with that of E-cadherin. We then screened cells expressing high levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H460 cells) or cytoplasm (SPC cells), as well as those expressing low levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H4299 cells) or cytoplasm (LK2 cells) for further study (Figure 2B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0088064.g002 Figure 2 Expression and localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin in H460, SPC, H1299 and LK2 cells. (A) Western blot analyses showed expression of p120ctn and E-cadherin in nine lung cancer cell lines and HBE. (B) By immunofluorescence analysis, the expression of E-cadherin and p120ctn were observed restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H460 and H1299 cells, whereas they both were confined to the cytoplasm in SPC and LK2 cells. Different functions of p120ctn isoform 1A in EMT are dependent on E-cadherin subcellular localization Knockdown of endogenous p120ctn isoform 1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin, snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells (Figure 3A). However, knockdown of endogenous p120ctn-1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A showed opposite results in SPC cells, where we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, snail and vimentin expression (Figure 3B). In comparison with the control, the ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A also enhanced the H460 cells invasiveness (17.33�1.25 vs. 36.33�1.70, P<0.01) (Figure 3C), whereas reduced the SPC cells invasiveness (23.0�0.82 vs. 13.0�0.82, P<0.01) (Figure 3D). These results revealed that the p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in EMT and cell invasiveness in different E-cadherin subcellular locations. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088064.g003 Figure 3 p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in regulating EMT in H460 and SPC cells. (A) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin, snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells. (B) SPC cells were treated as in (A) and the opposite results were obtained. (C) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A enhanced the invasiveness of H460 cells (**P<0.01). (D) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased the invasiveness of SPC cells (**P<0.01). Inhibitory function of p120ctn isoform 3A on EMT is not affected by differences in E-cadherin subcellular localization To verify whether p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in regulating EMT, their expression plasmids were transiently transfected into lung cancer cells with low expression of p120ctn (H1299 with membrane E-cadherin expression and LK2 with cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression). The western-blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A led to increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression (Figure 4A); on the contrary, the decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression were observed in LK2 cells (Figure 4B). Overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A also reduced the H1299 cell invasiveness (52.0�2.65 vs. 33.33�2.64, P<0.01) (Figure 4C), while enhanced the LK2 cell invasiveness (18.0�0.82 vs. 39.66�2.05, P<0.01) (Figure 4D).. Overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A led to increased E-cadherin expression, decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression (Figure 4A, 4B) and reduced cell invasiveness (52.0�2.65 vs. 29.66�1.53, P<0.01; 18.0�0.82 vs. 8.33�expression 0.47, P<0.01) (Figure 4C, 4D) in both of these cell lines. These results further confirmed that the p120ctn isoform 1A had a different effect on EMT depending on the subcellular localization of E-cadherin. They also revealed that the p120ctn isoform 3A maintained an inhibitory role in the EMT of lung cancer cells whether E-cadherin was localized to the membrane or the cytoplasm. 10.1371/journal.pone.0088064.g004 Figure 4 p120ctn isoform 3A maintains the role of inhibitiing EMT independently of E-cadherin localization. (A, B) Both H1299 (E-cadherin membrane localization) and LK2 cells (E-cadherin cytoplasmic localization) transiently transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid showed increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression. (C, D) Transient transfection of p120ctn isoform 3A plasmids into H1299 and LK2 cells resulted in decreased cell invasiveness (**P<0.01). (E) E-cadherin remained localized on the membrane in H1299 cells and in the cytoplasm of LK2 cells after transfection of the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid. Discussion The phenomenon of EMT in tumor cells often leads to decreased cell adhesion and increased mobility, and this transition is accompanied by decreased E-cadherin expression and increased expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and other mesenchymal biomarkers [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. As an important factor for stabilizing E-cadherin, p120ctn plays a role in inhibiting or promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion that is dependent on whether E-cadherin is expressed or not [16], [17]. Furthermore, p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A have shown different effects on E-cadherin expression and tumor cell invasiveness which are based on differences in the localization of E-cadherin [18]. These results strongly suggest that p120ctn most likely regulates the EMT of tumor cells by affecting E-cadherin expression and that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in EMT expressing E-cadherin in different subcellular locations. We first found that the p120ctn membrane expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin expression and negatively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis, while the cytoplasmic expression of p120ctn was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression and positively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis by immunohistochemistry. Although these results were consistent with previous studies [13], [14], they further suggested that p120ctn likely affects the EMT by influencing the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin and thereby the cell invasion and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To confirm the different impacts of p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A on EMT in cells expressing E-cadherin in different locations, we selected H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin membrane expression and SPC and LK2 cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression for further analysis. Plasmids expressing the p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A were constructed, and the full-length p120ctn siRNA was synthesized for these experiments. Since the sequence beyond amino acids 1�101 of p120ctn isoform 1A is similar to that of p120ctn isoform 3A [24], [25], we could not design an interference sequence specifically for p120ctn isoform 3A. Therefore, we had to further study the impact of the two isoforms on EMT and cell invasiveness in lung cancer cells with different E-cadherin locations specifically by knocking down p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 and SPC cells with high p120ctn expression and transfecting cDNA plasmids for exogenous p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A into H1299 and LK2 cells with low expression of p120ctn. Knockdown of p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 cells destroyed the epithelial cell adhesion complexes. E-cadherin expression was also downregulated due to the loss of its important stabilizing factor, p120ctn isoform 1A, which was consistent with previous studies [20], [26]. Decreased E-cadherin expression and disrupted cell-cell adhesion may induce EMT [27], [28], [43], [44], which results in increased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. On the other hand, overexpressed p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A was shown to bind E-cadherin located on the membrane proactively in tumor cells [29] and then inhibit the degradation of E-cadherin and stabilize its expression, contributing to the formation of effective epithelial cell adhesion complexes [30], [31], [32]. "
Lung_Cancer "As these series of processes maintained the normal cell-cell adhesion connection and inhibited EMT, there was increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression, as well as inhibited cell invasiveness in H1299 cells. Previous studies have shown that although p120ctn isoform 1A could bind E-cadherin in the cytoplasm, they could not form effective adhesion complexes on the membrane between epithelial cells [33]. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic E-cadherin is likely not to be the full-length E-cadherin but instead cleaved E-cadherin fragments, such as E-cad/sE-cad (80 kDa) and E-cad/CTF2 (33 kDa) [34]. The E-cad/CTF2 fragment can bind to p120 in the cytoplasm and then translocate into the nucleus and bind the transcriptional repressor of Kaiso to activate the Wnt/b-catenin pathway [35], [36], finally promoting the EMT of tumor cells and enhancing cell invasion and metastasis [37]. Moreover, others have shown that p120ctn-1A is related to abnormal expression of E-cadherin and poor prognosis [38]. These studies illustrated that the cytoplasmic p120ctn isoform 1A can play a role in promoting tumor cell EMT, invasion and metastasis. Based on the above, we observed on the one hand that the effect of p120ctn isoform 1A to promote tumor cell EMT, invasion and metastasis, would be lifted by its ablation, resulting in increased E-cadherin expression, decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and inhibited invasiveness in SPC cells. On the other hand, transfection of the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid into LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression, increased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. Although the precise role of p120ctn during EMT induction is still unclarified, previous studies suggested that knockdown of all isoforms of p120ctn could induce EMT indirectly [27], [28], [43], [44]. All inductions were based on decreased E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion in previous studies, which were also confirmed by our study in H460 cells with E-cadherin membrane localization. Unlike the H460 cells, knockdown of the p120ctn isoform 1A in SPC cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression could not decrease E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion. Instead, we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased cell invasiveness, indicating that the EMT could not be induced by this pathway in SPC cells. It was worth noting that the same result was observed in LK2 and H1299 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid, both showing increased E-cadherin expression, decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and snail expression and inhibited cell invasiveness. These results suggested that p120ctn isoform 3A has the function of inhibiting EMT of lung cancer cells, and this function is independent of the cellular E-cadherin localization. Past research had also confirmed a shift from p120ctn isoform 3A to p120ctn isoform 1A expression after the induction of EMT [9], [10], [11], which indirectly indicates that p120ctn isoform 3A may inhibit EMT while p120ctn isoform 1A promotes EMT. In addition, we also noticed that p120ctn and E-cadherin protein expression levels were significantly increased after transfection of the p120ctn-3A plasmid into LK2 and H1299 cells, but p120ctn and E-cadherin were still mainly restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H1299 cells. By contrast, E-cadherin and p120ctn were almost exclusively located in the cytoplasm in LK2 cells (Figure 4E). As a cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin is known to be only located on the cell membrane with the potential to inhibit EMT, while in the cytoplasm, it is often cleaved into fragments and therefore functions differently from the molecules located on the cell membrane [34]. Thus, the cytoplasmic E-cadherin would theoretically not play a role in inhibiting EMT. Based on the above analysis, we speculated that there may be some interaction between p120ctn isoform 3A and snail which plays a role in suppressing EMT in lung cancer cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin, but this hypothesis requires further study. Importantly, we also found that knockdown of p120ctn-1A in SPC cells with cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased twist expression (Figure 3B). Meanwhile, transfection of LK2 cells, which also showed cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin, with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid resulted in increased twist expression (Figure 4B). However, no changes in twist expression were observed in the rest of the experiments (Figure 3A, 4A). As a transcription factor and master gene regulator of EMT [39], [40], twist can downregulate E-cadherin expression [41] and upregulate N-cadherin and other mesenchymal biomarkers [42]. Increased twist expression in LK2 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid indicated that transcriptional activation took place and further suggested that the p120ctn isoform 1A may have translocated into the nucleus upon binding of E-cad/CTF2 in the cytoplasm, consequently activating the Wnt signaling pathway to promote EMT. Decreased twist expression in SPC cells transfected with p120ctn-1A-siRNA indicated that transcriptional activity was downregulated and suggested that ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A resulted in the inhibtion of EMT by removing the stimulatory effect of the Wnt signaling activity by p120ctn isoform 1A. In the H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin localized in the membrane, the unchanged twist expression confirmed that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A could bind to E-cadherin and maintain effective cell-cell adhesion in order to suppress EMT instead of affecting the Wnt/twist pathway. Intriguingly, overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A did not change twist expression in LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin, indicating that p120ctn isoform 3A did not activate transcription. Therefore, we firmly believe in the above hypothesis that p120ctn isoform 3A may interact with snail in some manner to influence E-cadherin expression and suppress EMT in lung cancer cells carrying cytoplasmic E-cadherin. Previous studies have observed that p120ctn-1A restored the cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin, whereas p120ctn-3A could not [20], which seems to be contradictory with the results of this study. However, the method in previous studies of knocking down p120ctn expression and then transfecting p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids into cells is different from that in the current study in which cells were only transiently transfected with p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids. Therefore, the different research methods may have led to different effects on E-cadherin. We also noted that in previous studies decreased and almost undetectable levels of E-cadherin by ablation of p120ctn resulted in the failure of exogenous p120ctn-1A to translocate into the nucleus to activate the Wnt/b-catenin pathway and decrease E-cadherin expression due to the deletion of the binding partner E-cad/CTF2. However, the LK2 and H1299 cell lines used in these experiments expressed E-cadherin in the present study. E-cadherin binds primarily to unphosphorylated p120ctn isoform 3A, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated p120ctn isoform 1A interacts exclusively with N-cadherin [23]. In the previous studies, exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A was prevented from binding and stabilizing E-cadherin after its ablation, while in the present study the exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A could stabilize E-cadherin expression directly on the membrane or indirectly by increasing its cytoplasmic expression via regulation of snail expression. Of course, all of these findings will need to be further investigated. In conclusion, we, for the first time, found that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A to have different functions in EMT of lung cancer cells with E-cadherin expressed in different subcellular locations. When E-cadherin was localized on the cell membrane, p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A both could inhibit EMT and reduce the cell invasiveness phenotype. When E-cadherin was localized in the cytoplasm, p120ctn isoform 1A promoted EMT and enhanced cell invasion, while p120ctn isoform 3A inhibited EMT and reduced cell invasiveness.

Lung_Cancer "In biomedical research, a health effect is frequently associated with protracted exposures of varying intensity sustained in the past. The main complexity of modeling and interpreting such phenomena lies in the additional temporal dimension needed to express the association, as the risk depends on both intensity and timing of past exposures. This type of dependency is defined here as exposure�lag�response association. In this contribution, I illustrate a general statistical framework for such associations, established through the extension of distributed lag non-linear models, originally developed in time series analysis. This modeling class is based on the definition of a cross-basis, obtained by the combination of two functions to flexibly model linear or nonlinear exposure-responses and the lag structure of the relationship, respectively. The methodology is illustrated with an example application to cohort data and validated through a simulation study. This modeling framework generalizes to various study designs and regression models, and can be applied to study the health effects of protracted exposures to environmental factors, drugs or carcinogenic agents, among others. � 2013 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. latency distributed lag models exposure�lag�response delayed effects splines 1. Introduction In biomedical research, it is commonly appreciated that an exposure event produces effects lasting well beyond the exposure period, with an increase in risk occurring from few hours to many years later, depending on the physiological processes linking the exposure and the health outcome. The problem is made even more complicated in the presence of protracted time-varying exposures, when the health effect measured at a given time can be described as the result of multiple exposure events of different intensities sustained in the past. This phenomenon, common to various research fields, has been associated for example with peak 1 or chronic exposures 2 to environmental stressors, drug intake 3,4, or occupational exposures to carcinogenic substances 5. The main complexity of modeling and interpreting such dependencies lies in the additional temporal dimension needed to express the association, beyond the usual exposure�response relationship, as the risk depends on both intensity and timing of past exposures. Nonetheless, the appropriate representation of the temporal pattern of risks may provide further insights on the association of interest, in particular regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and prevent biases in estimates and predictions. Revising previous terminology 6, I define these dependencies as exposure�lag�response associations. In particular, this issue has been debated in cancer epidemiology 7�9. Analytical approaches extend simple indices such as cumulative exposure, in order to accommodate the temporal variation in risk because of protracted exposures. In particular, the pioneering work by Thomas 10,6 helped develop sophisticated statistical methods on the basis of weighting past exposures through specific functions whose parameters are estimated by the data. Vacek 11, Langholz and colleagues 12, and Richardson 13 provided interesting applications in case-control studies, with weights represented through simple parametric functions. The methodology was improved by Hauptmann and colleagues in a series of papers 14�16 by using flexible and smooth spline functions. Sylvestre and Abrahamowicz 17 and Abrahamowicz and colleagues 18 extended the spline methods to the analysis of time-to-event data with a cohort design and presented their applications in pharmaco-epidemiology. The main limitation of the statistical techniques described in these papers is the assumption of a linear exposure�response relationship. Models for nonlinear dependencies introduce further nontrivial complexities, from both statistical and interpretational perspectives, as the problem becomes inherently bidimensional. Abrahamowicz and Mackenzie 19 proposed a model for analyzing the nonlinear time-dependent effects of fixed exposures, while Vacek 11 and Berhane and colleagues 20 extended this scheme to the case of protracted time-varying exposures. However, the modeling techniques illustrated in these other papers still face some limitations, as they are based on complex estimation routines with convergence issues and problems in producing uncertainty measures, such as standard errors and confidence intervals. Interestingly, equivalent approaches were previously established in time series analysis, on the basis of distributed lag models (DLMs), a methodology originally formulated in econometrics 21, then applied in epidemiological research 22. These models involve the definition of a distributed lag function, analogous to the weighting function described before. In particular, Armstrong 23 generalized the method to distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs), a class of models with different options for the functions applied to model nonlinearity and distributed lag effects. The theory of DLMs and DLNMs have been recently re-evaluated 24, offering a well-grounded statistical tool and a comprehensive scheme for interpretation. In this paper, I aim to establish a general conceptual and statistical framework for modeling exposure�lag�response associations, built upon the paradigm of DLMs and DLNMs. This modeling class, extended beyond time series analysis, provides a unified methodology applicable in different study designs, data structures, and regression models, including most of the previous methods as specific cases. Also, the statistical framework is defined by completely parametric functions and fitted through standard regression methods, with measures of uncertainty and fit statistics easily available. The R package dlnm, originally developed for time series data 25, is extended in parallel, offering a easy-to-use implementation of the modeling approach. The manuscript is structured as follows. The development and algebraic definition of the modeling framework is described in Section 2. As an illustrative example, in I apply the method for investigating the relationship between occupational exposure to radon and lung cancer mortality by using the data from the Colorado Plateau miners cohort. The modeling framework is then validated in a simulation study n. A final discussion is provided in. Information on data and software implementation is included in. The R code and data are included in the supporting information together with additional details, making the results of the illustrative example and of the simulation study entirely reproducible. 2. Modeling framework The modeling skeleton is derived by extending the class of DLNMs beyond the time series context. This extension provides a neat algebraic representation and a comprehensive statistical definition. The focus is on a function, here defined s(x,t), which describes the dependency in terms of the exposure history to x evaluated at time t. The function s(x,t) is commonly included in regression models in order to estimate the association, while controlling for potential confounders. Although the regression model varies depending on the study design and the type of data, the definition of s(x,t) provided later and the related modeling framework generally apply. 2.1. Models for linear exposure�response relationships Previous studies on the topic have defined the function s(x,t) by using slightly different algebraic formulae 10,26,11,14,17. Assuming a linear exposure�response relationship, a general notation can be given by (1a) (1b) (1c) In (1a), the increase in risk at time t is defined as the integral of the instantaneous exposure intensity xu over the period ?t = [t0,t1], with t0 and t1 representing the times of the first and last relevant exposures. Here, w(t ? u) is the weighting function previously described in, which assigns weights to past exposures experienced at time t ? u on the basis of their contribution to the risk at time t. The model can be reparameterized as in (1b), where the risk is now expressed along the lag, with ? ? [?0,L]. Here, L ? ?0 = t1 ? t0 is interpreted as the lag period over which an exposure to x is assumed to affect the risk at time t, usually with ?0 = 0. This parameterization offers the advantage that the function w is now directly defined in the new dimension of lag ?, and it is independent of the time axis chosen for t, which may represent different time scales depending on the study design. The function w(?), termed from here on as the lag�response function, models the lag�response curve associated with exposure x. Finally, for computational purposes, the integral is approximated in (1c) by a sum of terms derived by partitioning the lag interval in equally spaced discrete units and assuming the protracted exposure as a sequence of exposure events xt ? ? at lags ? = ?0, �, L. A statistical model for (1) can be defined by expressing the lag�response function w(?) as a linear combination of terms obtained through basis transformation, with related parameters. By using matrix notation, let the vector qx,t of exposure history be defined by (2) Such exposure history changes along time, depending on the time t at which the vector qx,t is computed. Given (2), the cumulative function s(x,t) in (1) can be written using a compact and general matrix notation as (3) The (L ? ?0 + 1) � v? matrix C is obtained from the transformation of the lag vector ? = [?0, �, ?, �, L]T, by choosing a specific basis with dimension v? for w(?), which defines the related basis functions. In this parameterization the function s(x,t), representing the integral of x � w(?) over the interval [?0,L], is defined as a lag�basis function with parameters ?. Interestingly, the equation in (3) is almost identical to that defining DLMs 24, Eq. (4). The different indexing in the original version reflects the specific application in time series, where the data are perfectly ordered in time, and the matrix Q has a structure such that qt,? ? qt + 1,? + 1. However, this is a specific case of the general representation in (2)�(3). The theory and software already developed for DLMs can be therefore extended in parallel. Alternative lag�basis functions for representing s(x,t) are derived through different lag�response functions w(?) in (1). In particular the traditional index of unweighted cumulative exposure is a specific case of (3), where reduces to with w(?) equal to a constant c. "
Lung_Cancer "This is obtained by specifying C as an (L ? ?0 + 1)-dimensional vector of 1's, with v? = 1. More sophisticated models with splines or other functions, such as those illustrated in publications cited in, only require the application of different bases for deriving C, but are nevertheless represented by 3). 2.2. Extension to nonlinear exposure�response relationships The extension to the nonlinear case presents further complexities, as anticipated earlier. The model in (1) can be extended by defining an additional exposure�response function f(x) to express the potentially nonlinear exposure�response curve along the dimension of the predictor. An intuitive generalization of (1) is: (4) with f(x) as the standard exposure�response function. However, the function f(x) � w(?) in 4), previously proposed 11,19, is not easily represented as a linear combination of basis variables and generates models that are not linear in their parameters and thus require ad hoc optimization routines. More importantly, this representation is based on the strong assumption of independency between f(x) and w(?), namely that the exposure�response shape is the same at each lag ?, and vice versa that the lag structure is the same at each value of x. This assumption can be relaxed by expressing s(x,t) as a truly bivariate function, with the more flexible representation: (5) Here the bidimensional function f � w(x,?) is defined as the exposure�lag�response function, and models simultaneously the exposure�response curve along x and lag�response curve along ?, namely an exposure�lag�response surface. Differently from 4), the exposure�lag�response function in 5) can be expressed as a linear combination of basis variables and related parameters through a special tensor product. As anticipated earlier, Armstrong 23 proposed the same approach for time series data within the DLNM framework, generalizing this tensor product parameterization through the concept of cross-basis. Specifically, two sets of basis functions are independently chosen to represent f(x) and w(?), respectively. The cross-basis is the bidimensional space of functions obtained by the combination of the two sets integrated over the lag dimension and represents the core of DLNMs. The algebraic representation has been previously presented 24, and a revised version is proposed here. Briefly, the simpler lag-basis for DLMs in 3) can be extended by choosing an additional basis with dimension vx for representing f(x). The application of the related basis functions to the vector of exposure history qx,t obtained by 2) generates a (L ? ?0 + 1) � vx matrix Rx,t. Let Ax,t be: (6) with 1v as a v-dimensional vector of 1's and C defined in 3). The cross-basis function s(x,t;?) can be defined as (7) In this case, the dimension of the cross-basis is determined by the product of the dimensions of the bases for the two spaces, and the association is expressed through vx � v? values W and related parameters ?. The cross-basis function s(x,t) represents the integral of f � w(x,?) over the interval [?0,L], cumulating the contributions of events representing the exposure history. In spite of the relatively complex algebraic form, the definition of cross-basis and the specification of DLNMs only amount to the choice of the bases for the functions f(x) and w(?). These can be independently selected between several options such as splines, linear threshold, or piecewise constant (step) functions. The DLNM modeling class comprises the simpler DLMs from Section 2.1. For example, the bidimensional exposure�lag�response function f � w(x,?) in 5) reduces to a non-linear function for un-weighted cumulative exposure f(x) � c when w(?) is a constant function c, and to the lag�response function x � w(?) in (1) when f(x) is simply an linear function of the untransformed x. The model proposed by Berhane and colleagues 20 can be written in the form of 6)�7) when both f(x) and w(?) are cubic B-splines. 2.3. Estimation and prediction Although the lag-basis and cross-basis functions in (1)�(3) and (5)�(7) involve a nonstandard parameterization in terms of exposure histories, DLMs, and DLNMs do not require specialized estimation procedures. The association is entirely expressed by the vx � v? parameters ? of the cross-basis values W. The computation of the exposure history in (2) can be extended to all N observations with x measured at time t, producing an N � (L ? ?0 + 1) matrix of exposure histories Q. The matrix of transformed variables W in (3) and (7) is consequently derived. This matrix can be included in the design matrix of standard regression models to estimate the parameters ?. In the completely parametric development proposed here, the number of coefficients vx � v? represents the degrees of freedom (df) used to model the association. Inference on the parameters ? and interpretation of the estimated association is aided by the prediction of specific risk measures. For simpler DLMs that assume a linear exposure�response relationship, this step reduces to the computation of a series of estimated risk contributions at lag ?p, with ?0 ? ?p ? L, and the associated (co)variance matrix . The series of risk contributions is provided by (8) with Cp obtained from the vector of lag ?p used for prediction, by applying the same basis functions for w(?) used for estimation. These estimated risk contributions compose the lag�response curve, and can be interpreted using either a forward or backward perspective. Namely, represents the risk contribution at time t + ?p in the future from a unit increase in exposure x at time t, or the contribution from a unit increase in exposure x occurring at time t ? ?p in the past to a given risk measured at time t. The estimated risk contributions associated with different exposure increases are easily derived. The equations in (8) only apply to DLMs with lag-bases as defined in (3). For DLNMs the association is allowed to vary nonlinearly in the space of x. Moreover, the specification in (5)�(7) allows the lag-response curve to change depending on the level of the exposure. The prediction of risk contributions corresponding to a specific exposure intensity xp at lag ?p, involves a more complex procedure. First, let be the (L ? ?0 + 1)-dimensional vector of exposure history with constant exposure xp. The related matrices and are derived from (6), substituting qx,t and C with and Cp, by applying the same two sets of basis functions for f � w(x,?) chosen for estimation. The exposure-specific risk contributions and associated (co)variance matrix are provided by (9) The estimated risk contributions may be interpreted as a lag-response curve similar to in (8), but this time associated with a specific exposure level xp instead of a unit increase. These measures may be used to define a grid of predicted risk contributions defined within the ranges of the exposure x and the lag ?, thus obtaining a bi-dimensional representation of the association. From this grid, besides above, it is also possible to derive the vector of lag-specific risk contributions , expressing the exposure-response curve for lag ?p. As noted in Section 2.2, the truly bivariate definition of (7) allows both the lag-response curve and exposure-response curve, defined by and respectively, to change depending on the specific exposure and lag values xp and ?p. The grid is interpreted as a risk surface along x and ? representing the exposure�lag�response. In addition, predictions in (8)�(9) may be extended to a generic exposure history qh. Substituting it into in (9) provides the vector of lag-specific risk contributions for each exposure that occurred within the lag period. The overall cumulative effect of such exposure history, with associated (co)variance matrix may be computed with: (10) The Equation (10) can be used to estimate the predicted cumulative risk for a given pattern of exposure qh. This method can also be applied to investigate how the risk progressively evolves along an exposure profile, computing the cumulative risk at each time associated with the time-varying exposure history qh. 2.4. "
Lung_Cancer "Identifiability and constraints The tensor product structure of the cross-basis defined in (5)�(7) poses some identifiability issues. In particular, each of the vx basis variables in R is multiplied by each of the v? basis variables in C. If an intercept is included in f(x), the related matrix of cross-basis variables W is not of full rank, and the parameters of the regression model are not identifiable, even when a common intercept is not included. Therefore the cross-basis in (7) should always be defined without an intercept in the basis functions for x. Also, these basis functions can be centered on a specific exposure value x0, which will represent the reference for the risk summaries computed by (8)�(10). The bidimensional shape of the exposure�lag�response can be constrained to follow a prespecified pattern. In particular, a priori assumptions on the lag structure can be imposed through functional constraints on the basis for the space of ?. Left and right constraints on the extremes of the supporting interval ?0�L are particularly meaningful for smooth functions. A left constraint can be imposed by excluding the intercept from the basis. This step will force the lag�response curve to predict a null risk at the beginning of the lag period. A right constraint on a B-splines basis can be produced by excluding specific basis variables, as previously described for linear exposure�response relationships 17. The constraint produces a smooth dependency which approaches a null risk at the end of the lag period. Such constraints are particularly useful in the presence of sparse data, in order to limit the flexibility of the model under specific assumptions about the lag�response curve. However, biases can be introduced if these assumptions are not met. Additional information is provided in Section D1 of the supporting information. The functional constraints discussed in this section can be specified without introducing customized optimization methods for estimating the parameters ? in (3)�(7). More sophisticated methods are required, for example, to constrain the lag�response curve to be non-negative in the whole lag period L. These approaches have been previously proposed for linear dependencies 14,17,18 and introduce further complexities in the bidimensional context of DLNMs. This development is not pursued here. 2.5. Model selection and inferential procedures The framework described in Sections 2.1�2.2 includes a fairly large number of models, defined by different functions for each of the two dimensions and by different choices regarding each function, such as number and location of knots in splines. This raises the issue of selecting the optimal model for describing the exposure�lag�response association. Previous studies on temporal dependencies have proposed selection procedures on the basis of profile likelihood 15, AIC 14,16,20 or BIC 17. Simulation studies seems to indicate a better performance of AIC when compared with BIC in this context 18, a result consistent with unpublished simulations performed on time series data for DLNMs. Inference on the models illustrated in the previous sections primarily focuses on the specification of confidence intervals for the risk measures in Section 2.3 and on the definition of tests for a set of null hypotheses. Confidence intervals for lag�response curves, exposure�response curves and cumulative risks obtained through , , and can be easily derived from the diagonal of the related (co)variance matrices in (8)�(10), assuming a multivariate normal distribution of the estimators. Regarding hypothesis testing, two null hypotheses are particularly relevant in this framework. The first one postulates a linear exposure�response relationship, namely H0 : f(x) = x. The second one assumes a constant risk, namely H0 : w(?) = c. Tests on constrained models can be also defined. The assumption of independency is not easily tested, as the form in (4) cannot be expressed as a model linear in its parameters. However, defining general inferential procedures in this setting is not straightforward. First, the null hypotheses H0 : f(x) = x and H0 : w(?) = c are not independent, and an incorrect assumption about the association in one dimension may bias the test estimator for the hypothesis related to the other space, as previously reported 19. In addition, estimates are usually conditional on a posteriori selection of a best-fitting model, based on the selection methods discussed before. Under these conditions, the estimators for the (co)variance matrices in (8)�(10) are likely to underestimate the true sampling (co)variance, and the distribution of the test statistics may be different from that assumed unconditional on the selection procedure. This may generate undercoverage of confidence intervals and inflated type I error for tests 17,27. Given these complexities, a general framework for hypothesis testing embedded in the model selection procedure is not provided here. An assessment through simulations of the performance of estimators generated by AIC and BIC-selected models will be presented in. Specifically, simulations will provide an empirical evaluation of the ability of the information criteria to identify the correct model between those defining the null or alternative hypotheses about linearity and constant effects, and measures of performance such as bias, coverage, and root mean square error. 3. An application The conceptual and statistical framework of DLNMs described in, extended beyond time series data, is general and applicable in different study designs. As an illustrative example, I propose here an application in survival analysis of time-to-event data. This represents one of the most complex settings, as the temporal pattern of risk is produced by exposure histories that vary during the follow-up of each subject. Specifically, the methodology is used to investigate the association between occupational exposure to radon and mortality for lung cancer. The analysis is based on data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort, already used in previous methodological contributions 12,15,20. Section A of the supporting information provides a list of the main steps to replicate the analysis in other real-life examples. 3.1. Data The cohort data used in this example were collected by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Detailed information on the cohort is given elsewhere 12. Briefly, subjects were eligible to enter the cohort if they worked in mines within the Colorado Plateau area between 1950 and 1960, and provided demographic, personal and occupational information during their working period. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained by linkage with different sources. The data used in this example refer to the follow-up of the cohort on December 31, 1982, including 3347 subjects and 258 lung cancer deaths. Exposure data available in the data set include cumulative measures of radon and smoking in 5-year age intervals. The radon exposure history for each subject, expressed in working-level months (WLM), was reconstructed by linking employment information with measured or predicted levels in each mine in each year. The smoking history, expressed in the number of cigarettes packs � 100, was reported by each subject during his working period and assumed constant after the last reporting age. A summary of the data is provided in Table I. Table I Descriptive statistics of the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The data included here refer to the follow-up on December 31, 1982.

Modeling strategy For this illustrative example, the analysis is performed through a Cox proportional-hazard model with time-varying covariates by using age as the time axis. Effect measures are reported as a hazard ratio (HR). The model is represented by the following: (11) where the log-hazard log [h(t)] is expressed as a sum of baseline log-hazard log [h0(t)] and contributions of additional covariates. These comprise cross-basis functions sx(x,t) and sz(z,t) for radon and smoking respectively, as defined in (1)�(7), and a linear term for calendar time u, in order to control for secular trends in lung cancer risk not accounted for by the delayed effects of the two exposures."
Lung_Cancer "Radon is the exposure of interest and is modeled with different combinations of bases for f(x) and w(?) in the cross-basis sx(x,t). Given the limited information on smoking histories, in this analysis, the cross-basis sz(z,t) is a priori defined with a natural cubic B-spline with one knot at the median of 2.5 yearly packs � 100 for the exposure�response and a step function with a single cut-off at lag 20 for the lag structure, with lag period 2�40 years. However, different cross-basis functions can be applied. The model spends 5 df controlling for confounders, and a different amount for modeling the effect of radon, depending on the chosen cross-basis sx(x,t). Modeling exposure�lag�response associations in time-to-event data assumes the definition of an extended version of continuous time-varying predictors, namely the varying exposure history for each subject at the ages he contributes to different risk sets 28. The lag scale is chosen as years, with lag 0 identifying the exposure during the last year. The lag period is fixed at 2�40, assuming no effect of exposure after 40 years and in the last 2 years, consistently with previous analyses. Multiple exposure histories are computed for each subject at the ages he contributed to each risk set, given his exposure profile reconstructed from the 5-year periods. This step produced matrices of exposure histories Qx and Qz for radon and smoking respectively, as defined in (2). These matrices are used to specify the lag-bases or cross-bases matrices Wx and Wz from (3)�(7), included in the design matrix of the Cox model. Additional information is provided in the Section B of the supporting information. The functions f(x) and w(?) composing sx(x,t) for the model candidates are selected a priori among linear, constant, piecewise constant functions, and quadratic B-splines, with 36 models in total. Specifically, the three cut-offs of a piecewise constant function and combinations of 0, 1, or 2 knots for B-splines are placed at quartiles for the dimension of x, corresponding to 26.7, 60.2, and 122.2 WLM/year, and at 13.3, 20, or 26.6 lags for the dimension of ?. Also, in alternative parameterizations of w(?), the intercept is excluded in the B-spline bases, left-constraining the smooth lag�response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. This a priori assumption reasonably follows the hypothesis that the risk associated with past exposures smoothly increases from zero starting from lag 2. Model selection is based on AIC and BIC adapted to survival analysis, given by the following: (12) where is the log-likelihood of the fitted model, k is the number of total df, and d is the number of uncensored events. The best-fitting model (11) is chosen by minimizing AIC or BIC in (12). Both criteria apply a multiplicative constant to the number of parameters for penalizing more complex models. In particular, the penalty of BIC (equal to log(d)) is usually higher and tends to select simpler models. 3.3. Results for distributed lag models Results for simple DLMs, assuming a linear radon�mortality relationship on the log scale, are illustrated first. Table II presents models with different functions w(?), as defined in (3). Specifically, model 1 is specified by a constant (intercept only) function, producing a lag-basis identical to the traditional index of unweighted cumulative exposure; model 2 is an example of a DLM with a piecewise constant function; the best-fitting B-spline models with and without intercept, specified by a single knot at 13.3 lags are reported as models 3 and 4, respectively. The fit of the various options is expressed by AIC and BIC, with the best performance achieved by model 1 for both criteria. This model assigns the same importance to the exposures experienced ? lags earlier in defining the risk for a given time. The specification of more flexible functions with more df does not seem to improve the fit. Table II Functions f(x) and w(?), total degrees of freedom (df) associated with the cross-basis, and values for the AIC and BIC for alternative models for the exposure�lag�response association between radon and mortality.

The curves are composed of a series of estimated contributions to the risk of mortality for lung cancer at each lag ?, associated with an increase of 100 WLM/year in radon exposure, with defined in (8). The results can be interpreted following the scheme described in Section 2.3. By using a forward perspective, represents the HR contribution from a unit increase in exposure experienced at t to the subsequent risk at t + ?, with ? = 2, �, 40 years. Alternatively, adopting a backward perspective, the same summary is interpreted as the HR contribution from a unit increase in exposure experienced at t ? ? to the overall risk at t. Model 4 predicts a maximum increase in risk at lag 11, with a HR of 1.042 (95%CI: 1.031�1.052), compared with the constant HR of 1.031 (95%CI: 1.025�1.036) estimated from model 1. Figure 1 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure to 100 WLM/year in the lag period of 0�40 years. The figure shows the lag�response curves estimated from models 4 (with 95%CI), 2, and 1, as specified in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The better performance of model 1 seems to indicate that the hypothesis of constant risk H0 : w(?) = c is supported by the data. Also, the lag�response curve from model 4 in Figure 1 does not suggest a decrease in risk at longer lags, although the confidence intervals are relatively wide in this part of the lag period. 3.4. Results for distributed lag non-linear models The results illustrated in Section 3.3 are dependent on the strong assumption of a log-linear relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality. The analysis can be repeated with more flexible DLNMs, which can describe simultaneously nonlinear exposure�response relationships and lag structures through the specification of a cross-basis in (5)�(7). The definition of DLNMs involves a higher number of potential models, obtained by different combinations of bases for the functions f(x) and w(?). The second part of Table II only reports models with the same choices for w(?) used in DLM, and with f(x) specified as another piecewise constant function and the B-spline providing the best fit, with one knot at 60.2 WLM/year. Overall, the best-fitting option for both AIC and BIC is model 8, with a B-spline for both f(x) and w(?). This model uses 9 df in total for expressing the bidimensional association. The hypothesis H0 : f(x) = x of a linear radon-mortality dependency is not supported by the data, as all the DLNMs show a substantial decrease in both AIC and BIC, when compared with simpler DLMs. In particular, the comparison of the best-fitting model 8, representing f � w(x,?), with model 4, representing x � w(x,?), indicates that the 6 additional df substantially improve the fit. Similarly, the hypothesis H0 : w(?) = c of a constant risk along lags, previously suggested when evaluating DLMs, is not supported either. The comparison of model 8 with model 5, representing f(x) � c, indicates a better fit of the former. Interestingly, this result is the opposite of what was suggested in Section 3.3, revealing how imposing a wrong assumption about the relationship in one dimension induces spurious results in the other space, compromising the analysis of the association. The interpretation of results from DLNMs relies on a bidimensional representation of the exposure�lag�response association. This is achieved by computing the risk contributions over a grid defined in the range of the exposure x and the lag ?, applying (9). This bidimensional dependency is depicted in the two top panels of Figure 2, showing the predicted HR surfaces from models 8 and 6, in the range 0�250 WLM and 0�40 lags. The graphs show an initial increase in risk along lags, peaking at approximately 10 years after the exposure, and then decreasing and apparently disappearing after about 30 years, independent of the exposure levels. The inspection of the panels along the dimension of x reveals the nonlinear radon-mortality dependency, with the risk increasing steadily up to 50 WLM/year, and then flattening out. The shape of the HR surfaces unveils the different assumptions underlying the choices of bases for functions f(x) and w(?), namely B-splines and piecewise constant functions. Figure 2 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0�250 WLM/year and lag period 0�40 years. The figure shows 3-D graphs of the exposure�lag�response association on a grid of exposure � lag values (from model 8, top left, and model 6, top right), lag�response curves for radon exposure of 100 WLM/year (from models 8, with 95%CI, and model 6, bottom left), and exposure�response curves at lag 15 (from models 8, with 95%CI, and models 6 and 4, bottom right). The models are described in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Although the 3-D representation offered by the top panels in Figure 2 provides an overview of the bidimensional association, it is still limited for inferential purposes, as the uncertainty in the estimate is not reported. In order to extend the interpretation, the analysis can focus on the risk along ? predicted for specific exposure intensities, or alternatively the risk along x for specific lags, namely the vectors and from Section 2.3. These dependencies are represented by slices cut on the bidimensional risk surface along the appropriate dimension. The bottom panels of Figure 2 report the lag�response curve corresponding to an exposure level of 100 WLM/year and the exposure�response curve for lag 15 from both Models 8 and 6, together with 95% confidence intervals for the former. These curves correspond to the two bold lines in the 3-D plots. The bottom-left panel is interpreted similarly to the DLM in Figure 1 as the specific risk contributions composing the lag�response curve, but this time associated with a specific exposure xp = 100 WLM/year. The curve estimated from model 8 peaks at lag 11, with an HR of 1.21 (95%CI: 1.16�1.26), and both models 8 and 6 suggest that the risk disappears after 30�35 years. The B-spline for w(?) in model 8 is left-constrained by the lack of an intercept, forcing the smoothed lag�response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. The best fit of Model 8 if compared with model 7, which includes the intercept, seems to support this hypothesis. The bottom-right panel shows instead the risk contributions at ?p = 15 for different exposure intensities and is interpreted as the exposure�response at t from exposures experienced at t ? 15 (backward perspective), or the exposure�response contributions at t + 15 from exposures experienced at year t (forward perspective). Although models 8 and 6 adopt different bases for functions f(x) and w(?), the estimates of the predicted risk along x and ? are consistent, showing a radon-mortality relationship that is markedly nonlinear and nonconstant in time. These measures of risk are extended in Figure 3, reporting estimates from model 8 for different exposure and lag values. A right-constrained version of Model 8 is discussed in Section D.1 and illustrated in Figure S2 of the supporting information. Figure 3 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0�250 WLM/year and lag period 0�40 years. The figure shows lag�response curves for radon exposure of 20, 50, 100, and 200 WLM/year (left), and exposure�response curves at lag 5, 10, 15, and 20 (right), estimated from model 8, as specified in Table II. "
Lung_Cancer "Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Interestingly, even though model 8 is produced from the flexible definition in (5)�(7), Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the assumption of independency holds here, with shapes of the exposure-response and lag-response curves at different values of ?p and xp respectively being proportional, and the maximum HR constantly experienced at lag 11. This result reinforces the fact that the cross-basis representation, based on a truly bivariate exposure�lag�response function f � w(x,?), may appropriately describe the specific independency case defined by the simpler representation f(x) � w(?) in (4). 3.5. Prediction for specific exposure histories The flexible modeling approach described here can be applied to predict the overall cumulative risk from (10) for a specific exposure history qh, as outlined in Section 2.3. Table III illustrates the predicted HR from four different models in five alternative exposure scenarios. This approach, previously proposed 17, provides clear and interpretable risk summaries from complex models in the presence of varying exposure patterns. The first two scenarios refer to a constant radon exposure of 20 and 100 WLM/year, respectively, in the past 10 years. As expected, simple DLMs (models 1 and 4) predict a similar risk, but substantially lower than the two DLNMs with a B-spline for f(x). In particular, model 5 extends model 1 by allowing a nonlinear dependency for the unweighted cumulative exposure, estimating a slightly lower risk when compared with the more flexible model 8 already described. The third scenario extends the exposure to 20 WLM/year in the previous 20 years, while the fourth one assumes that a 10-year exposure to the same intensity ceased 10 years before. The comparative assessment of the four models is similar to the first two examples. The last scenario considers the risk of more remote exposures, occurring 30�39 years ago. Interestingly, models 1 and 5 provide identical estimates to the fourth scenario, as the risk of past exposures is assumed constant along the whole lag period. Model 8 instead predicts no excess in lung cancer in the last scenario, given at least 30 years passed from the last exposure to radon, a lag period for which the lag�response curve in Figure 2 (bottom-left panel) displays a null risk. Table III Overall cumulative hazard ratio (with 95%CI) of lung cancer mortality associated with alternative scenarios of exposure histories to radon, as predicted from models 1, 4, 5, and 8, described in Table II Model 1 Model 4 Model 5 Model 8 Exposure scenario x � c x � w(x,?) f(x) � c f � w(x,?) 20 WLM/year in the last 10 years 1.05 (1.04�1.06) 1.04 (1.03�1.05) 1.33 (1.22�1.46) 1.52 (1.31�1.76) 100 WLM/year in the last 10 years 1.27 (1.22�1.33) 1.20 (1.13�1.27) 1.96 (1.73�2.22) 2.37 (1.87�2.99) 20 WLM/year in the last 20 years 1.11 (1.09�1.14) 1.11 (1.09�1.14) 1.92 (1.56�2.35) 3.12 (2.29�4.24) 20 WLM/year 10�19 years ago 1.06 (1.05�1.07) 1.07 (1.06�1.09) 1.43 (1.28�1.61) 2.05 (1.70�2.48) 20 WLM/year 30�39 years ago 1.06 (1.05�1.07) 1.05 (1.00�1.11) 1.43 (1.28�1.61) 1.04 (0.64�1.70) WLM, working-level months. The summaries illustrated in this section can be extended to predict how the risk evolves dynamically in time in association with time-varying exposures. Adopting a forward perspective, the risk changes along an exposure profile, with specific exposures events referring to different lags and producing a different exposure history. As an example, Figure 4 displays the overall cumulative mortality risk within years 0�60 for an exposure to 20 WLM/year experienced in the first 15 years. Here, model 8 predicts an HR peak of 2.94 (95%CI: 2.20�3.93) at around 20 years, 5 years after the end of the exposure. The plot also suggests that model 4, assuming a log-linear exposure�response relationship, seriously underestimates the risk of lung cancer for four decades, predicting an HR at year 20 of 1.11 (95%CI: 1.09�1.13). Also, the assumption of a constant risk along lags of a nonlinear relationship, adopted in model 5, produces an underestimation of the predicted HR in the first part of the period, followed by a clear overestimation in the last years. Figure 4 Trend of hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality in the period 1�60 years associated with radon exposure of 20 WLM/year experienced in years 1�15, predicted from models 8 (with 95%CI), 5, and 4, as specified in Table II. 3.6. On linearity and the �nonspecial� case of log transformation The bottom-right panel of Figure 2 reports the exposure�response for the simple DLM in model 4, which predicts a substantially lower risk than the two DLNMs. This difference is also evident when comparing the HR range in Figures 1 and 2 (bottom-left panel). This discrepancy is related to the wrong assumption of a linear radon-mortality dependency, with the fit of model 4 highly dependent on a few of very high exposure occurrences. A sensitivity analysis performed on the subset of subjects with a maximum yearly exposure to radon of less than 300 WLM/year (81.6% of the total) is illustrated in Section D.2 of the supporting information. The highly skewed distribution of exposure events to radon and the shape of the estimated exposure�response curve suggest a log transformation of the exposure. In fact, this model can be still described as a DLNM in (5)�(7), characterized by a basis with dimension vx = 1 corresponding to f(x) = log(x + 1). A new model is defined by replacing the spline in model 8 with the log function. The comparison is presented in details in Section D.3 of the supporting information. Although this more parsimonious model slightly improves the fit, with an AIC of 2148.6, it is worth noting that results are very similar, as illustrated in Figure S4 (supporting information), suggesting that the spline function is flexible enough to recover the association. More generally, different functions than those presented here can be used to define the exposure�response or lag structure. 4. Simulation study The performance of the extended DLNM framework is validated through simulations, under different scenarios of exposure�lag�response associations. Specifically, the framework is evaluated by estimating the relative bias, coverage and relative root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimators derived from AIC and BIC selection, and the empirical rejection rates for the hypotheses H0 : f(x) = x and H0 : w(?) = c of linearity and constant effects, respectively. 4.1. Simulation design and data generation The simulation setting involves the generation of exposure profiles for a set of ns subjects, the definition of scenarios with known bidimensional exposure�lag�response associations, and the random generation of time-to-event occurrences from such scenarios. These steps are briefly summarized here, with more detailed information provided in Section E of the supporting information. The time-varying exposure profiles for ns subjects are represented as series of occurrences xt at time t = 1, �, 100, generated by random exposure events with an intensity in the range 0�10. "
Lung_Cancer "The time-varying exposure profiles for ns subjects are represented as series of occurrences xt at time t = 1, �, 100, generated by random exposure events with an intensity in the range 0�10. The exposure�lag�response associations are defined by the function fs(x) � ws(?) in (4), which is simpler to simulate if compared with the truly bivariate alternative in (5), for each value of exposure x and lag ?. Different scenarios explore alternative choices for the exposure�response function fs(x) and the lag�response function ws(?). These are obtained by simple mathematical functions involving logarithms or exponentials. Specifically, fs(x) is specified as linear, plateau, and exponential, while ws(?) as constant, decay, and peak (see Figure S7 in the supporting information). Three scenarios out of the nine possible combinations are shown in the top panels of Figure 5, the others in Figure S8 (supporting information). Figure 5 Results of the simulation study for three scenarios of exposure�lag�response associations (linear-constant, plateau-decay, and exponential-peak, in each column). The graphs illustrate the true simulated 3-D exposure�lag�response association (first row), and the lag�response (second�third rows) and exposure�response curves (fourth�fifth rows) from AIC and BIC-selected models, corresponding to the bold lines in the 3-D plots. These last panels compare the true simulated associations with the average of the estimated associations, together with a sample of estimated curves corresponding to the first 25 simulations (in grey). Results from m = 500 simulated data sets with ns = 400 subjects. Time-to-event data are simulated conditional on the cumulative contribution of the simulated exposure, using a permutational algorithm previously proposed for time-varying exposures 29. The cumulative effect is calculated in the form of a function defined in (4), given the exposure history of each subject at time t, over a lag period 0�L, with L = 40. Censoring events are included and represent approximately 25% of the total. For each of the nine scenarios, m = 500 data sets are simulated with a number of subjects ns equal to 200, 400, or 800. 4.2. Evaluation of performance For each data set i = 1, �, 500, the exposure�lag�response association is estimated by Cox regression models with a cross-basis as defined in (5)�(7). The Efron method is used for tie handling. Similarly to the example in, the exposure�response function fe(x) is specified as a simple linear term, or quadratic B-splines with 0,1, or 2 knots placed at 3.3, 5, or 6.7. The lag�response function we(?) is specified as a simple constant term with 1 df, or quadratic B-splines with intercept and 0, 1, or 2 knots placed at 13.3, 20, or 26.7 lags. The total number of df for the cross-basis function se(x,t) ranges from 1 � 1 = 1 to 4 � 5 = 20 in the 36 models. For each simulated data set, the best-fitting models are selected as those minimizing AIC and BIC in (12), respectively. Performance is formally evaluated using a synthetic risk summary ?c from (10), corresponding to an overall cumulative effect, and then visually assessed on the whole exposure�lag�response association. The formal evaluation consists in the computation of different ?c,i at each ith iteration, given an exposure history qh,i evaluated at a random time t between 41 and 100 for a random individual among the ns subjects. Indices of relative bias, coverage and relative RMSE are derived from the following: (13) where I is an indicator function, and ?? 1(1 ? ?) is the quantile function of the cumulative normal distribution related to probability 1 ? ?, with ? = 0.05. The effect summary ?c,i corresponds to the true effect from , while is estimated from the best fitting model selected by AIC and BIC, by using , given the specific exposure history qh,i of the random subject at the random time. This approach assures that the performance indicators in (13) are evaluated on the whole range of simulated exposure histories, and do not depend on a specific choice. A visual inspection of performance is also provided by computing from the best-fitting models the grid of risk contributions defined in (9) composing the exposure�lag�response surface. Bias is then assessed across the surface by comparing the average fit of the the m = 500 models with the true exposure�lag�response relationship. A bidimensional display of coverage is also provided for each scenario. The performance of the AIC and BIC are also evaluated through their empirical rejection rate for the hypotheses of linearity or constant effect, namely the proportion of times the selection procedure favors a model with a non-linear term for fe(x) and a non-constant term for we(?). When H0 is true, namely fs(x) = x or ws(?) = c, the rejection rate is an estimate of the probability of error of the selection criteria, which wrongly select unnecessarily complex models. When H0 is false, namely fs(x) ? x or ws(?) ? c, the rejection rate is an estimate of the power of the selection criteria for identifying non-linearity and constant lag structures. In a formal hypothesis testing setting, these measures would be interpreted as the type I error and the power of the test. 4.3. Results of the simulation study The results of simulations under the nine scenarios with ns = 400, producing approximately 300 uncensored events, are summarized in tables in graphs. Table IV reports the formal evaluation of performance on the synthetic risk summary ?c, in terms of relative bias, coverage, and relative RMSE. A visual assessment for three scenarios is provided in each column of the multi-panel Figure 5. The true simulated exposure�lag response associations are displayed in the top panels, while the other panels offer a comparison of the true lag�response and exposure�response curves at specific values with the average of the estimates from AIC and BIC-selected models, together with a sample of 25 individual curves. Table IV Synthetic indices of relative bias, coverage and relative root mean square error (RSME) for the nine scenarios of exposure�lag�response associations.

The values of relative RMSE suggest that the higher variability of AIC-based estimators is often balanced by the higher bias affecting BIC. At least part of the bias can be attributed to lack of fit, due to the insufficient flexibility of quadratic spline functions when used to fit logarithmic or exponential shapes. This phenomenon appears quite relevant for the plateau-type exposure response, characterized by the highest relative bias, in the order of 4�7% for AIC but up to 21% for BIC (see Table IV and Figure 5, second column). This pattern is confirmed by the results in Table V, showing the average df in each dimension and the empirical rejection rates for the hypotheses of linearity and constant risk. The AIC selection is affected by moderate overfitting, sometimes suggesting flexible models in scenarios of linear and/or constant risk. In contrast, BIC shows severe underfitting, often selecting simple models for complex exposure�lag�response associations, in particular regarding linearity.

The latter, as discussed in Section 2.5, may generate undercoverage through the underestimation of the true sampling (co)variance. A comparison of the importance of the two sources can be provided by the assessment of undercoverage in the first scenario, where linear and constant functions are actually among the options of the selection procedure, and the underlying simulated association can be potentially recovered with no lack of fit. In this scenario, AIC-selected models affected by overfitting show a coverage of 91%, very close to the nominal value, as illustrated in Table IV. The under-coverage seems to be proportional to the bias, as confirmed by Figure 6, with a lower coverage corresponding to sections of the bidimensional space characterized by worse fit. Figure 6 Empirical coverage across the risk surfaces for three scenarios of exposure�lag�response associations (linear-constant, plateau-decay, and exponential-peak, in each column). Results from m = 500 simulated data sets with ns = 400 subjects. The simulated examples with ns = 200 and ns = 800 generate approximately 150 and 600 uncensored events, respectively. The versions of Tables IV�V and Figure 5 for these examples are reported in Tables S2�S5 and Figures S9�S10 of the supporting information. The comparison suggests that varying the sample size does not dramatically affect the performance of the AIC-based test, apart from the expected different power in identifying nonlinear and noncostant exposure�time�response associations. Consistently, AIC-based selection seems to perform well across the range of number of subjects included in the analysis, with a small bias and reasonable coverage. The results of this simulation study are consistent with previous findings on one-dimensional models for exposure�lag�response associations assuming a linear exposure�response relationship 18. 5. Discussion In this contribution, I illustrate a statistical framework for modeling temporal dependencies with time-varying exposures, defined here as exposure�lag�response associations. The approach is based on the extension of distributed lag non-linear models, a modeling class previously proposed in time series analysis 23,24. The extended DLNM methodology brings together and extends previous methodological developments on the topic, as summarized in. Briefly, it provides a unified framework for different study designs and regression methods, and is applicable to time series, cross-sectional, case-control, survival, and longitudinal data. A major advantage is the possibility to describe the lag structure of either linear or nonlinear exposure�response relationships, through the choice of two functions that define the association along the dimensions of the predictor and lags, including most of the previous approaches as special cases. The example in illustrates how such flexibility is important for obtaining correct estimates of the association. Model specification easily accounts for previous knowledge on the association and incorporates assumptions on the phenomenon to be investigated, through the choice of specific functions, lag period and constraints. Interpretation of complex exposure�lag�response associations is aided by the definition of simple summary measures of effect and prediction, and by graphical representation. The modeling framework is defined through a neat and compact algebraic representation, including the derivation of measures of uncertainty such as standard errors and confidence intervals. Estimation is carried out with standard regression models, which do not require specialized optimization procedures, and may include terms for multiple exposure�lag�response dependencies, as shown for radon and smoking here. The parameterization, prediction and graphical representation are carried out with few general functions implemented in a freely available and documented software, as discussed in. A key issue of the DLNM methodology is about selecting the appropriate model among different options for modeling the bidimensional exposure�lag�response relationship. The simulation study in indicates that AIC-based selection performs reasonably well over a range of 150�600 uncensored events, while the strong penalty of BIC induces the selection of models too simple to recover the underlying dependency."
Lung_Cancer "The overfitting characterizing AIC-selected models in scenarios of simple exposure�lag�response dependencies does not seriously affect its performance, a result in line with previous findings 18. However, AIC-selected models also suffer from bias and undercoverage of confidence intervals to some extent. Part of this seems to be related to the limited flexibility of the functions applied in the simulation study and may be described as a smoothing problem rather that an inherent limitation of the estimators. It should also be noted that the simulation study only evaluates a limited set of exposure�response and lag�response shapes, simulated under the assumption of independency. Different functions, such as cubic splines, and more complex exposure�lag�response surfaces will be assessed in future simulation studies. Also, an extension of DLNMs with penalized splines, characterized by higher flexibility can be explored as well, exploiting previous research on bivariate smoothing techniques 30,31. A related problem is about the inferential procedures being conditional on a posteriori selection of the best-fitting model. Previous studies on unidimensional models have proposed a correction for the inflation of type I errors in tests on a constant effect along lags 17,27. However, this approach is not easily extended to the bidimensional setting of exposure�lag�response associations, and the definition of a hypothesis testing procedure for DLNMs is left to future developments. Although a posteriori selection may also be a source of undercoverage of confidence intervals, its impact seems to be limited if compared with that associated with lack of fit, at least in the simple scenarios investigated in the simulation study. Another limitation is the lack of a formal testing procedure on the hypothesis of independency. As suggested in Section 3.4, a graphical assessment of the proportionality of exposure�response and lag�response curves, such as those in Figure 3, can help investigating the issue. Further research is needed to provide more consistent inferential procedures in this setting. The analysis of the temporal evolution of the risk associated with protracted time-varying exposures has straightforward applications in different research fields. For example, the DLNM methodology may be used to characterize the risk of chronic exposures to occupational or environmental factors, to differentiate the role of exposures sustained at different ages in life course studies, or to define the temporal frame of beneficial or adverse effects of drugs in clinical trials and pharmaco-epidemiology. The development of this methodology and software implementation provide a promising analytical tool for biomedical research. 6. Software and data All the analyses presented in this paper were performed using the R software version 3.0.1 32. The DLNM modeling framework is fully implemented in the package dlnm 25, by using the expressly extended version 2.0.0. The permutational algorithm for simulating time-to-event data in the presence of time-varying exposures is implemented in the package PermAlgo 29, version 1.0. Both packages are available through R from its central repository. The data of the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort in the form of a comma-separated values file is included in the supporting information,� together with the R scripts for the analysis performed in the example and the simulation study of Sections 3�4, which are entirely reproducible. In particular, the script example.R provides a short illustration of the modeling framework. Versions of the scripts updated to future versions of the dlnm package will be available at http://www.ag-myresearch.com. Distributed lag non-linear models were originally conceived and developed for describing temperature�health associations in time series data by Ben Armstrong. The data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort were collected by the researchers of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. I am grateful to Bryan Langholz for kindly making data and documentation available. The simulation study was performed using the high-processing computing system at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Lung_Cancer "Background The development of a rash has been retrospectively associated with increased response and improved survival when treated with erlotinib at the standard dose of 150 mg per day. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the association of the activity of erlotinib in the first-line setting in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the development of a tolerable rash via dose escalation of erlotinib or tumor characteristics. Methods Patients, with advanced NSCLC without prior systemic therapy, were treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally per day. The dose was increased by 25 mg every two weeks until the development of grade 2/tolerable rash or other dose limiting toxicity. Tumor biopsy specimens were required for inclusion. Results The study enrolled 137 patients, 135 were evaluable for safety and 124 were eligible and evaluable for response. Only 73 tumor samples were available for analysis. Erlotinib dose escalation occurred in 69/124 patients. Erlotinib was well tolerated with 70% of patients developing a grade 1/2 rash and 10% developing grade 3 rash. Response rate and disease control rate were 6.5% and 41.1% respectively. Median overall survival was 7.7 months. Toxicity and tumor markers were not associated with response. Grade 2 or greater skin rash and low pMAPK were associated with improved survival. Conclusions Overall survival was similar in this trial compared to first-line chemotherapy in this unselected patient population. Dose escalation to the development of grade 2 skin rash was associated with improved survival in this patient population.

Existing pathway analysis techniques are mainly focused on discovering altered pathways between normal and cancer groups and are not suitable for identifying the pathway aberrance that may occur in an individual sample. A simple way to identify individual�s pathway aberrance is to compare normal and tumor data from the same individual. However, the matched normal data from the same individual are often unavailable in clinical situation. Therefore, we suggest a new approach for the personalized identification of altered pathways, making special use of accumulated normal data in cases when a patient�s matched normal data are unavailable. The philosophy behind our method is to quantify the aberrance of an individual sample's pathway by comparing it with accumulated normal samples. We propose and examine personalized extensions of pathway statistics, overrepresentation analysis and functional class scoring, to generate individualized pathway aberrance score. Results: Collected microarray data of normal tissue of lung and colon mucosa are served as reference to investigate a number of cancer individuals of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon cancer, respectively. Our method concurrently captures known facts of cancer survival pathways and identifies the pathway aberrances that represent cancer differentiation status and survival. It also provides more improved validation rate of survival-related pathways than when a single cancer sample is interpreted in the context of cancer-only cohort. In addition, our method is useful in classifying unknown samples into cancer or normal groups. Particularly, we identified �amino acid synthesis and interconversion� pathway is a good indicator of LUAD (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.982 at independent validation). Clinical importance of the method is providing pathway interpretation of single cancer, even though its matched normal data are unavailable.

The analysis of altered pathways in an individual cancer patient may help to understand the disease status and suggest customized anticancer therapies.It is straightforward to compare the molecular profile of an individual�s tumor and normal cells to discover molecular aberrances specific to his/her cancer. However, it may not be feasible in the current clinical practice environment to perform a metastatic tumor biopsy at the time of treatment resistance in patients with advanced cancer (Dancey et al., 2012). A case study of custom-tailored medicine based on an individual�s genome and transcriptome highlights this limitation (Jones et al., 2010). A patient�s tumor had metastasized to the lung after surgery at the primary site. A biopsy from his lung tumor was analyzed by mutation and transcription profiling; however, the patient�s normal lung tissue was not biopsied. Because there was no matched normal tissue, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the patient�s own blood and information collected from various normal tissues were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results of pathway analysis based on DEGs, integrated copy number variation and mutation information led the doctor to change the patient�s drug treatment, and the disease was stabilized for 3 months.Although the personalized interpretation of pathways can be demanding, most current pathway analyses have been developed to investigate deregulated pathways between two phenotype groups. Khatri et al. (2012) classified these methods into three types: overrepresentation analysis (ORA), functional class scoring (FCS) and a pathway topology (PT)-based approach.ORA approaches typically apply an arbitrary threshold value (e.g., fold change >2 or P < 0.05) on gene expression to assess whether the number of genes beyond threshold are significantly over- or underrepresented in the given pathway. There are two drawbacks to ORA. First, it uses only the most significant genes and discards others, thus resulting in information loss for marginally significant genes (Breitling et al., 2004). Second, it considers only the number of genes and does not consider the magnitude of expression changes, leading to information loss regarding the importance of genes (e.g. a gene with a fold change of 2.01 and a gene with a fold change of 4 are considered equally). Unlike ORA, FCS methods do not discard genes with an arbitrary threshold but use all available genes, which is an improvement over ORA (Tian et al., 2005). PT methods are essentially based on FCS methods with the addition that they consider network topology information. They compensate for the common limitation of ORA and FCS in reporting false-positive gene sets due to sets of overlapping genes. In our article, we focus on ORA and FCS methods, extending and implementing each for personalized pathway analysis.There are two exceptional studies examining individualized pathway analysis (Drier et al., 2013; Vaske et al., 2010). PARADIGM is a tool that infers a pathway status by using known functional structures. The method models the functional structure of pathway as a set of interconnected variables, where the variables are omic objects such as DNA, mRNA and protein, where the interaction between variables describes the functional status of a pathway. PARADIGM may perform better with multiple omics, as it uses known functional relationships between a gene or inter-gene DNA and protein. Hence, it might not perform well with single layer omic data, such as from mRNA microarrays.Drier et al. (2013) proposed a personal pathway deregulation score (PDS), which represents the distance of a single cancer sample from the median of normal samples on the principal curve. To calculate PDS, they reduced the dimensions by principal component analysis and found the best principal curve, using entire cohort samples containing both normal and/or different stages of cancers. Drier�s method performs better than PARADIGM in the mRNA only datasets of brain and colon cancers. Calculating PDS requires data dependent preprocessing steps, including selecting the number of principal components to be used and filtering out noisy gene data to obtain optimized principal curves. PDS fully uses whole cohort data to interpret an individual�s pathway, which can be a drawback in that it requires a number of cohort data to extract principal curve to interpret a single patient data. It has a limitation to interpret a single sample such as a patient�s recurrent tumor that is not accompanied with cohort dataset to extract the principal curve.Our proposed method is based on the comparison of one cancer sample with many accumulated normal samples (we use �nRef� to refer to the accumulated normal samples) that is different from the previous studies in following sense. The proposed method is suitable to adopt single-layer omics data and expendable to interpret a patient in the context of many published or user-defined pathway gene sets. PARADIGM has less freedom in terms of data and gene sets, as it prefers multi-layered omics data and requires predefined functional structure among omics objects. Unlike PDS, which extracts the principal curve from entire cohort data, our method does not assume an individual sample belongs to a cohort. We introduce using accumulated normal tissue data as a reference. This is a simple and biologically intuitive guideline in such a case to interpret a single sample that lack cohort data.Our method provides a series of analysis steps, which consists of four parts: data processing, gene-level statistics, individualized pathway aberrance score (iPAS) and a significance test. To discover the most feasible method for iPAS, we extend existing pathway analysis techniques, namely, ORA and FCS, to properly reflect the nature of testing one cancer to many normal samples.To demonstrate that iPAS captures biologically and clinically relevant information in a sensible, valid and useful manner, we apply it to samples of lung and colon adenocarcinoma. We show that our representation generates clinically relevant stratifications and outcome predictors, which would not have been achieved when the same data are analyzed by the conventional method that does not use accumulated normal data.Our empirical study suggests two different strategies, depending on the biological question that iPAS is focused on. In the case of cancer diagnosis, a method that uses the inter-gene correlation structure of the accumulated normal samples performs best. In the case of cancer prognosis, a simple averaging of all member genes� standardized gene expression values performs best.2 METHODS AND MATERIALS2.1 Gene expression dataWe built nRef by the manual curation of data obtained from NCBI GEO (Barrett et al., 2012). Microarray data of adjacent normal tissues obtained from patients undergoing surgery were selected to serve as the nRef. Data from biopsied samples, primary cultures of normal tissues and post-mortem donors were not included in the nRef. We collected 120 nRef for lung, 60 from GSE19804 (Lu et al., 2011), 27 from GSE7670 (Su et al., 2007) and 33 from GSE10072 (Landi et al., 2008). Samples came from individuals with variable smoking histories and different ethnic backgrounds. We collected 101 nRef� for colon, concentrating on normal mucosa tissue samples from six datasets available at GEO. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in survival analysis, we used Beer�s data of 442 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) (Beer et al., 2002) to discover survival-related pathways and validated the associations of 61 LUAD samples of GSE8894 (Lee et al., 2008). The pathway based identification of LUAD were tested on 120 cancers and 120 normal samples of GSE19804, GSE7670 and GSE10071. Further validation was conducted with 48 cancers and 35 normal samples collected from GSE19188 (Hou et al., 2010) and GSE31547. For patient stratification by colon cancer differentiation status, we used 566 microarrays of GSE39582 (Marisa et al., 2013), which provided in a separate manner, 443 for discovery, 123 for validation. GSE17536 (Smith et al., 2010) was also used for validation.2.2 Pathway dataInformation from gene sets representing biological pathways were obtained from REACTOME (Croft et al., 2011), which are also provided in the Molecular Signature Database (Subramanian et al., 2005). Pathways with small number of genes are more easily understood by human experts. We decided to filter out pathways of which gene set size is >97. The cutoff covers at least 80% of contents of each public pathway resources. Of 674 pathways in REACTOME, 583 pathways (86.7%) remained after filtering by the gene set size.2.3 Individualized analysis using the nRefThe aim of our approach is to identify altered pathways in an individual by making use of the nRef. A schematic diagram of our method of individualized pathway analysis is described in Figure 1, and the following sections describe each step. Fig. 1.Schematic description of individualized pathway analysis using accumulated normal data (nRef). An individual�s tumor data are normalized with the nRef. Gene expression is standardized by mean and SD of the nRef. The iPAS is calculated from standardized gene expression values in the pathway. Null distribution calculated from the nRef provides significance2.3.1 Data preprocessing and gene-level statisticsExpression level was defined by using the robust multichip average (Irizarry et al., 2003). For datasets using different microarrays, only those with probes in common from Affymetrix U133A to Affymetrix U133Plus 2.0 were used for further analysis. For individual tumor cases, we performed quantile normalization (Bolstad et al., 2003) after combining the single tumor microarray with all nRef samples. In cases of genes with multiple probes, gene expression level was summarized by averaging probe-level expression. Individual tumor sample gene expression was standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the reference.2.3.2 "
Lung_Cancer "Pathway-level statistics and significance testWe introduce five methods as candidates for iPAS. Each method is a modification of existing pathway analysis techniques, enabling us to test an individual tumor sample�s pathway aberrance by using the nRef. A summary is provided in Table 1. Table 1.Modification of existing pathway analysis methods for iPASNote. Significance can be obtained against the null distribution generated from normal samples. All the collected normal samples for the nRef are one by one compared with the nRef to yield statistics of the null distribution. A statistic from a single cancer case is compared with this null distribution to yield P-value.Average ZStandardizing the gene expression by mean and standard deviation from datasets is often used in microarray analysis. A vector Z = (z1, z2, � , zn) denotes the expression status of a pathway where zi symbolizes the standardized expression value of i-th gene, where the number of genes belonging to the pathway is n. In typical settings, standardization is performed using the mean and SD of a given dataset, mostly the cancer-only cohort data, thus y�/n indicates how much the given sample�s overall pathway gene expression deviates from the center of the cancer samples. We made the simple modification, Z� = (z1�, z2�, � , zn), where zi� is derived from mean and SD of the nRef. In this case, y'�/n gives the samples deviation from the nRef. We believe this modification is biologically valid because every cancer starts its malignancy from normal cell. Thus, the clinical characteristics of a single cancer can be captured by measuring the difference of it against common characteristic of normal cells, which is represented by the nRef in our study.Fisher exact testWe generated a 2 � 2 contingency table for a given pathway (S) and DEGs (D) for the test. For individualized interpretation, we define D by the ranking of z-value, which is standardized gene expression for the mean and SD of the nRef. For each individual sample, 5% (highest 2.5% and lowest 2.5%) of the total genes are defined as D. We applied a two-tailed test to detect alteration of pathways due to enrichment or depletion of differential genes. The result of this statistic can be interpreted as how many DEGs are enriched in the given pathway, where the expression difference refers to how much a patient�s gene expression deviates from the nRef.Gene set enrichment analysisWe adopted the original version of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) proposed by Subramanian et al. (2005). Typically, inputs for GSEA are generated by testing whole cohort samples using phenotype label; t-statistic, correlation coefficients and fold changes are usually used. In the personalized analysis setting, we use the z-value as an input for the GSEA algorithm, which is standardized gene expression by mean and SD of the nRef. The GSEA output enrichment score reflects the degree to which a gene set in the pathway is overrepresented at the extremes (low or high) of the entire ranked list of z-values from a single patient.Non-parametric quadratic testGene expression in a pathway of a tumor sample is represented by vector Z = (z1, z2, � , zn), where zi is standardized expression level of i-th gene by mean and SD of the nRef, where n is the number of genes belonged to the pathway. A pathway characteristic of an individual patient�s pathway can be represented by the averaged Euclidean distance (ZTZ/n). This gives the distance of a single patient from the center of the nRef due to the square of standardized expression difference, and thus does not reflect increased or decreased expression, only the extent of the expression difference. Genes in the pathway are usually functionally correlated; therefore, use of the correlation structure of the normal samples may increase sensitivity enough to capture the aberrance of a single cancer case. We also consider the averaged Mahalanobis (ZTSZ/n) distance, which uses the covariance matrix calculated from the nRef. This value describes the statistical distance from the center of normal samples taking into account correlation among normal samples. The covariance matrix S is calculated for each pathway from the nRef.3 RESULTS3.1 Pathway-based identification and validation of cancer survivalTo assess whether our method can sensitively detect pathway aberrances that are associated with a patient�s clinical outcome, a known survival pathway that showed strong association with patient survival from Beer�s data was tested. Bryant et al. (2010) reported that the �cell cycle stimulatory� pathway of 51 genes is significantly associated with patient survival (Cox proportional hazards model, P = 0.000113). In that study, pathway gene expression was represented as an average of z-values, where the z-value indicates the standardized expression level, by the mean and SD, of all cancer samples. The high-risk group was defined as those in which pathway expressions were >0, and the pathway showed poor prognostic outcome. The association was significant with or without adjusted clinical covariates, and thus the pathway alone is a strong indicator of cancer prognosis. This finding was also validated in the Japanese LUAD cohort (n = 87, survival data are not provided to public) in Bryant�s study. As studies have shown a clear association between the cell cycle pathway and cancer, in terms of driving cancer proliferation, we considered this pathway as a pathway that should be detected. All of the methods proposed as candidates for iPAS showed significant associations of the �cell cycle stimulatory� pathway from Beer�s data (Table 2). The same pathway analyzed using GSE8894 (n = 61) data yielded significant associations in all proposed methods with the marginal exception of Mahalanobis (P = 0.0549).

Prostate_Cancer "The combination of sulforaphane and TRAIL is superior to single treatments in reducing self-renewal potential. (A) DU145 and PC3 cells were left untreated or were treated with 10 ?M sulforaphane; after 24 h, TRAIL was added at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. After an additional 24 h, the nuclear proteins were harvested and DNA binding was analyzed by EMSA using a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe for the NF-?B promoter consensus sequence. The specific NF-?B shifts are marked. Competition with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (10 � C) served as a control for the binding specificity. (B) Twenty-four hours after TRAIL treatment, the cells were trypsinized and re-plated in a normal medium at a low density (500 cells/well) in 6-well plates. Ten days later, the cells were stained, and colonies containing >50 cells were counted under a dissecting Zeiss Stemi DV4 microscope.

Background In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), recent evidence has demonstrated the persistence of the intratumoral androgens. The multi-step androgen synthesis pathway originates from cholesterol, which can be obtained by cells from several major sources including intracellular synthesis through an enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). The inhibition of this enzyme by the use of statins has been investigated in prostate cancer as a possible therapeutic target for blocking the de novo androgen synthesis resulting in decreased tumor growth. However, the effectiveness of statins in CRPC has not been investigated. Methods Castration-resistant C4-2 and androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were treated with Simvastatin for 48 hours. Dose-dependent responses to Simvastatin were analyzed using cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. Cellular growth curve was generated using haemocytometer. HMGCR activity was assessed using 14C-acetic acid detected by thin layer chromatography, and the protein expression was quantified using western blot analysis. Intracellular cholesterol and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results Significant decrease in cell viability and growth curve observed at 75 ?M of Simvastatin compared to no treatment group in the castration-resistant C4-2 cells. HMGCR activity was significantly decreased up to 50% and 70% at 50 ?M and 75 ?M of Simvastatin respectively compared to the vehicle control in C4-2 cells. Simvastatin did not affect the protein expression. 80% decrease in the amount of total intracellular cholesterol levels was observed in 75 ?M Simvastatin treatment group compared to vehicle control. PSA secretion levels were significantly reduced in the C4-2 cell line at 50 ?M and 75 ?M of Simvastatin compared to vehicle control. Conclusion The inhibition of HMGCR via Simvastatin lowered the viability of castration-resistant C4-2 cells. Simvastatin�s ability to limit the endogenous supply of cholesterol contributes to the effects seen in cell viability. Simvastatin Castration-resistant prostate cancer HMGCR Cholesterol synthesis Background Prostate cancer (PCa) occurs in the form of an unregulated cellular growth in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system, leading to symptoms such as erectile dysfunction, hematuria, and pain. PCa is commonly diagnosed in men over the age of 50, after which incidence rates increase with age; it is the most common cancer diagnosed among North American men, accounting for 28% of all cancers diagnosed, and is the second most common cause of cancer death among the same cohort (10%) in 2012 [1,2]. Upon diagnosis, local PCa is treated with surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Within the prostate gland, androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) promote cell growth and proliferation via androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-responsive transcription factor. Upon ADT, 99% of prostate cancer patients reach 5-year survival due to apoptotic regression of tumor from the lack of androgen growth stimuli [3,4]. However, patients with metastatic prostate cancer are subject to temporary remission. Eventually the tumor regrows despite the depleted level of circulating androgens that is insufficient to support the prostate tumor growth; this is referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [3,4]. Previously CRPC has been known as an �androgen independent� cancer due to its ability to grow and metastasize despite the low androgen environment. Recent findings by multiple groups however have shown that CRPC cells have the ability to produce their own intracellular androgens that promote growth via AR activation without having to rely on exogenous androgen supply � known as intratumoral de novo steroidogenesis [5,6]. Androgen levels within metastastic tumors of castrated men are found to be higher than the levels within the primary prostate cancer tumors in untreated men [7]. In addition, CRPC tumors are shown to continuously express the necessary enzymes to create androgens intracellularly [8,9]. While the steps towards androgen production consist of multiple pathways, all the steps originate from a common upstream precursor molecule, cholesterol [10]. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is comprised of complex and multiple regulatory pathways as cholesterol has important functions in humans including regulating membrane fluidity, influencing cellular signaling, and being a precursor for bile and androgens [11]. Cells obtain cholesterol from two major sources: exogenous and endogenous supplies. Exogenous cholesterol supply involves uptake of cholesterol from circulating lipoproteins via membrane transporters such as Scavenger Receptor Class B Type I (SR-BI) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr). Once in the cell, cholesterol is stored as cholesteryl esters in lipid droplets and metabolized accordingly to cell�s demand for cholesterol via acetyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAT) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Endogenously, cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA in the endoplasmic reticulum through is the mevalonate pathway, in which the rate-limiting is step 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) that is responsible for converting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) into mevalonate [11,12]. Mevalonate molecule further undergoes multiple reactions to be converted into cholesterol downstream. While normal physiological cholesterol homeostasis is tightly regulated, it has been shown that this process is dysregulated in CRPC, suggesting a constant, unregulated supply of cholesterol to meet cellular requirements including supply for de novo steroidogenesis [6,13,14]. A potential site of dysregulation has shown to be at site of cholesterol uptake via SR-BI; our group has shown that SR-BI protein expression was significantly increased upon progression to castration-resistance in the LNCaP xenograft model [8]. Also, upon inhibition of cholesterol uptake via SR-BI silencing in vitro, a compensatory cholesterol synthesis via increased HMGCR activity was identified and significant decreases in prostate specific antigen (PSA) and cell viability of CaP cells were observed [15]. However, relevant changes in total cholesterol concentration and androgen levels were not seen, most likely due to the activation of compensatory cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR [15]. Recently, our group has demonstrated that HMGCR expression and activity, and thereby cholesterol synthesis, was increased during CRPC progression in LNCaP xenografts [6,16]. Statins, inhibitors of HMGCR, have been the subject of many PCa studies with mixed results [17-19]. Recently, an association between statin users and a reduction in the onset of the aggressive, late-stage disease state was reported and has been paired with decreased serum androgens [20]. However to date, only a handful of research has looked directly at the effect of statin as a treatment option for CRPC; it has been shown that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis via statin prevents cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis through reduction in nuclear factor-?B activity [21]. However there are limitations to the studies with regards to cell line specificity, and the lack of cholesterol metabolism data. The present study sought to determine the role of HMGCR in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in terms of cell viability, cholesterol synthesis, and PSA production when the cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR is blocked with Simvastatin. LNCaP and C4-2 cells share similar features by expressing AR and producing PSA; C4-2 cells are lineage-derived second generation subline of LNCaP cells that were derived by subcutaneous co-inoculation of LNCaP and osteosarcoma cells in castrated mice [22]. Therefore, LNCaP cells were selected as the appropriate control cell line. Results C4-2: castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line Cytotoxicity of simvastatin treated C4-2 cells The cytotoxicity of cells was measured based on the presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the media, which indicates poor cellular membrane integrity and cell lysis. LDH in media causes the conversion of a tetrazolium salt reagent into a red formazan product, which the absorbance can be measured at 492 nm. Results are expressed as values normalized to a 100% death control which represents untreated cells lysed with a 1% Triton X-100 solution. The means of the cytotoxicity measured at different Simvastatin doses were compared to the Vehicle Control, consisting of 0.5% DMSO. The means were found to be significantly different at 60 ?M, 75 ?M, 80 ?M, 100 ?M, and 250 ?M in C4-2 cells (Figure 1). Figure 1 Cell cytotoxicity is demonstrated as % cytotoxicity based on a 100% cytotoxic control, representing the amount of LDH in the media of C4-2 cells treated with increasing dose of Simvastatin.

Cell viability and growth curve of simvastatin treated C4-2 cells The cell viability was measured based on the presence is of dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells which are able to bioreduce the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) tetrazolium reagent into a colored formazan product that can be measured at 490 nm, producing signal measurements that are directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The viability of cells was normalized to protein levels (?g) in the respective cell samples. As shown in Figure 2, cellular viability, expressed as fold change from negative control, decreased significantly at 75 ?M, 80 ?M, 100 ?M, 250 ?M, and Triton-X 1% control for C4-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

As shown in Figure 3, the only significant difference in the growth pattern of C4-2 cells upon Simvastatin treatments compared to vehicle control was at 75 ?M of Simvastatin at Day 8. Despite the difference in the growth rate of C4-2 cells at 75 ?M compared to vehicle control at Day 5, the difference was not statistically significant.

HMGCR activity and protein expression ?-scintillation readings of silica gel at a Rf value of approximately 0.25 indicated the location of cholesterol on the stationary phase as compared to positive cold cholesterol control sample. The measurements were used to assess the cholesterol synthesis activity via HMGCR enzyme by the incorporation of radiolabeled acetate precursor molecule into cholesterol synthesis pathway. The ?-scintillation readings (14C DPM/3H DPM) were normalized to protein levels (?g) as measured by Lowry assay. The mean cholesterol synthesis activities in C4-2 cells significantly decreased up to 50% and 70% upon 50 ?M and 75 ?M of Simvastatin respectively compared to vehicle control group (Figure 4).

Corresponding cell viability results were observed where cellular viability, expressed as fold change from negative control, decreased significantly at 75 ?M, 80 ?M, 100 ?M, and 250 ?M, and Triton-X 1% control (Figure 9). The control LNCaP cells showed a cumulative growth curve that was showed a significant difference in the growth pattern of upon 75 ?M of Simvastatin treatment compared to vehicle control at Days 5 and 8 (Figure 10). Upon Simvastatin treatments, LNCaP cells displayed a significant reduction in cholesterol synthesis activity is at 75 ?M of Simvastatin treatment as shown in Figure 11; however, no significant changes were observed in the HMGCR expression across the Simvastatin doses (Figure 12). The total intracellular cholesterol concentrations, normalized to protein levels (mg), showed a significant reduction in the total cholesterol concentration at 75 ?M of Simvastatin compared to vehicle control (Figure 13). The decrease in cholesterol levels corresponded to the decrease in HMGCR protein activity at 75 ?M Simvastatin treatment results. Despite the change in cholesterol synthesis activity and total intracellular cholesterol concentration, there were no significant changes observed in the levels of PSA secretion (ng/mL) of LNCaP cells, normalized to the amount of protein (mg), upon Simvastatin treatments (Figure 14).

Discussion In the past castration-resistant prostate cancer, now with a median overall survival of 18.4 months with combination therapy of docetaxel and AR blocker MDV3100, was misunderstood as an �androgen independent� form of prostate cancer based on the observations that it is able to recur and more importantly aggressively metastasize in patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy [23]. As mentioned however, many groups have reported the continuous expression of AR and activation of the AR-androgen signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer through both in vitro as well as in vivo studies despite the androgen castrated environment, supporting the existence of an intracellular de novo androgen synthesis pathway rather than the tumor�s ability to sustain itself despite the lack of androgens [24-27]. HMGCR has been shown to be essential regulator for provision of cholesterol to the androgen synthesis pathway in the steroidogenic tissues of the body [15]. Upon progression to castration-resistance in LNCaP xenograft model, an increase ex vivo HMGCR activity has been observed [6]. Also, in castration resistant cell model upon the knockdown of SR-BI transporter a significant increase in HMGCR activity was observed [15]. These finding suggests that castration-resistant cells may adapt to the low androgen environment by increasing cholesterol synthesis to supply cellular needs as well as providing the precursor for de novo androgen synthesis. While suggesting an important role of this enzyme in intracellular de novo androgen synthesis and potentially suggesting common HMGCR inhibitors such as statins as possible therapeutic agent, the effect of inhibiting HMGCR in a castration-resistant model has not been investigated. The current study aimed to investigate the physiological relevance of one source of cholesterol to the cell, HMGCR, a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis-mevalonate pathway. Simvastatin is a commonly used drug to control hypercholesterolemia to prevent cardiovascular disease, and as such epidemiological studies have shown significantly lower serum PSA, tumor volume, and percentage of cancer in radical prostatectomy samples in PCa patients on preoperative statins compared to non-users [28,29]. As mentioned, the effects of statins in prostate cancer models have been extensively studied in cell and animal models as well, reporting a decrease in tumor viability and proliferation in PC-3 in vitro model as well as reduction in PSA production in mice in vivo model; however, the effects have not been thoroughly investigated in CRPC models [24-27]. The treatment of Simvastatin in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells confirmed the cytotoxic effects as seen in previous studies (Figure 1). In addition, the inhibition of HMGCR activity via Simvastatin significantly stunted the cellular growth of castration-resistant C4-2 cells in a similar dose-dependent manner as the control LNCaP cells (Figures 1 and 8). The two cell lines were shown to display cellular cytotoxicity, viability, and growth curve patterns that are not significantly different from each other; both cell lines showed nearly 50% reduction in cell viability after 48 hour incubation of 75 ?M of Simvastatin (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Cholesterol is an important precursor molecule in the pathways involved in the production of androgens, which stimulate prostate growth; the changes in growth and proliferation seen in Figures 1, 2 and 3 may be a result of cholesterol synthesis alteration caused by Simvastatin. Upon Simvastatin treatments, C4-2 cells showed significant changes in the HMGCR activity, normalized to protein amount (?g), at 50 ?M and 75 ?M of Simvastatin (Figure 4). Corresponding to past studies which reported an increase in ex vivo HMGCR activity upon progression to castration-resistance in a LNCaP xenograft model, the current study also reported a five-fold increase in basal cholesterol synthesis activity in the no treatment groups of C4-2 cells compared to LNCaP cells as shown in Figures 4 and 11 [6]. Upon examining the HMGCR protein expression levels, Simvastatin treatment did not significantly alter the expression of the HMGCR protein in C4-2 and LNCaP cells (Figures 5 and 12); as a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR, statins are not known to affect the enzyme function via silencing mechanism. Corresponding to the HMGCR activity results, at 75 ?M of Simvastatin both cell lines showed a significant decrease in the intracellular cholesterol content, normalized to protein levels (mg) (Figures 6 and 13). However in C4-2 cells, upon 50 ?M of Simvastatin, the intracellular cholesterol quantity remained the same despite the decrease in HMGCR activity, which may be an indication of compensatory pathways activation to supply the cell with the necessary cholesterol source via other cholesterol homeostasis pathways despite the inhibition of HMGCR (Figures 4 and 6). An important indication of AR-androgen pathway activation is the production of PSA, which is produced in response to transcription of genes that contain androgen response elements (AREs). Similar to the PSA observations seen in previously published papers, the basal PSA secretion levels in C4-2 cells was significantly higher; the current study showed an increase that is approximately five magnitude greater in C4-2 cells than the amount secreted by LNCaP cells (Figures 7 and 14) [30]. While previous studies have reported a lack of change in the level of AR protein expression between LNCaP and C4-2 cells, statin use has been shown to decrease the expression and activity of the AR via suppression of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [15,30] These finding indicates the existence of a continuous androgen supply, and whether there is a greater total amount of androgens to activate the AR or the ligand-receptor binding interaction is stronger in C4-2 cells is unknown. Furthermore, the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis significantly reduced the secreted PSA levels in C4-2 cells at 50 ?M and 75 ?M of Simvastatin compared to vehicle control, while no differences were observed in LNCaP cells across the treatment groups implicating that the decrease in cholesterol synthesis has a greater effect in castration-resistant state and supporting the hypothesis of existence and greater reliance on intracellular de novo steroidogenesis in CRPC. In addition to the competitive inhibition of HMGCR, Simvastatin like most other statins may exert cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects through direct inhibition of small signaling molecules; by inhibiting HMGCR, statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis as well as the synthesis of isoprenoids which are important lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 [31,32]. Despite the decreases in HMGCR activity, total intracellular cholesterol, and PSA, if a constant intracellular testosterone level across the Simvastatin treatment groups were observed, it may indicate that the signaling processes are being affected. In the current study, the decrease in PSA secretion may be due to the direct effect of Simvastatin on cholesterol-androgen production and androgen receptor activation and/or indirect effect on the signaling pathways. The effect of regulating the cholesterol homeostasis pathway to alter the growth of CRPC cells has also been seen in cholesterol influx regulation [15]. "
Prostate_Cancer "Recently scavenger-receptor class B type I (SR-BI) receptor has also emerged as a potential therapeutic target of interest in investigating PCa progression as well as de novo androgen synthesis due to the discovery of a significant increase in the SR-BI protein expression in CRPC cells compared to non-castrated LNCaP cells [15]. SR-BI receptor is one of the two major cholesterol influx transporters, mainly uptake of cholesterol esters bound to high density lipoprotein (HDL) via a docking mechanism. It has been shown that down-regulation of SR-BI expression via gene silencing significantly reduced the viability of C4-2 cells, and at a greater extent compared to LNCaP cells [15]. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the amount of PSA secreted by both C4-2 and LNCaP cells was observed when comparing SR-BI knockdown to negative control cells [15]. However, the limitations of the study were that no corresponding differences in intracellular cholesterol and androgen levels were observed. The results from the current study looking at inhibition of cholesterol synthesis via use of Simvastatin reported a significant reduction in cell viability, intracellular cholesterol levels, PSA secretion, and cholesterol synthesis activity in C4-2 cells upon Simvastatin treatments. It would be worthwhile to investigate the inhibition of multiple cholesterol regulatory pathways including cholesterol influx and synthesis using combination treatment of SR-BI silencing and Simvastatin to assess the effect of a combination treatment in CRPC models. Conclusion In summary, the inhibition of HMGCR via Simvastatin lowered the viability of castration-resistant C4-2 cells. Simvastatin�s ability to limit the endogenous supply of cholesterol likely contributes to the effects seen in cell viability.

Prostate_Cancer "American Association of Physicists in Medicine Purpose: Feasibility of targeted and volumetric hyperthermia (40�45?�C) delivery to the prostate with a commercial MR-guided endorectal ultrasound phased array system, designed specifically for thermal ablation and approved for ablation trials (ExAblate 2100, Insightec Ltd.), was assessed through computer simulations and tissue-equivalent phantom experiments with the intention of fast clinical translation for targeted hyperthermia in conjunction with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Methods: The simulations included a 3D finite element method based biothermal model, and acoustic field calculations for the ExAblate ERUS phased array (2.3 MHz, 2.3 � 4.0 cm2, ?1000 channels) using the rectangular radiator method. Array beamforming strategies were investigated to deliver protracted, continuous-wave hyperthermia to focal prostate cancer targets identified from representative patient cases. Constraints on power densities, sonication durations and switching speeds imposed by ExAblate hardware and software were incorporated in the models. Preliminary experiments included beamformed sonications in tissue mimicking phantoms under MR temperature monitoring at 3 T (GE Discovery MR750W). Results: Acoustic intensities considered during simulation were limited to ensure mild hyperthermia (Tmax < 45?�C) and fail-safe operation of the ExAblate array (spatial and time averaged acoustic intensity ISATA < 3.4 W/cm2). Tissue volumes with therapeutic temperature levels (T > 41?�C) were estimated. Numerical simulations indicated that T > 41?�C was calculated in 13�23 cm3 volumes for sonications with planar or diverging beam patterns at 0.9�1.2 W/cm2, in 4.5�5.8 cm3 volumes for simultaneous multipoint focus beam patterns at ?0.7 W/cm2, and in ?6.0 cm3 for curvilinear (cylindrical) beam patterns at 0.75 W/cm2. Focused heating patterns may be practical for treating focal disease in a single posterior quadrant of the prostate and diffused heating patterns may be useful for heating quadrants, hemigland volumes or even bilateral targets. Treatable volumes may be limited by pubic bone heating. Therapeutic temperatures were estimated for a range of physiological parameters, sonication duty cycles and rectal cooling. Hyperthermia specific phasing patterns were implemented on the ExAblate prostate array and continuous-wave sonications (?0.88 W/cm2, 15 min) were performed in tissue-mimicking material with real-time MR-based temperature imaging (PRFS imaging at 3.0 T). Shapes of heating patterns observed during experiments were consistent with simulations. Conclusions: The ExAblate 2100, designed specifically for thermal ablation, can be controlled for delivering continuous hyperthermia in prostate while working within operational constraints. hyperthermia MR-guided HIFU endorectal ultrasound phased array beamforming modeling simulation CCC information 0094-2405/2014/41(3)/033301/18/$30.00 sisac 0094-2405()41:3L.033301;1 edcode 13-1276R1 aipkey 1.4866226 spin KART 2012 8750yt 8755dh 8755dk 8719Pp 8710Kn 8761Tg US 12 biodiffusion biomedical MRI biomedical transducers bone cancer finite element analysis hyperthermia phantoms physiological models radiation therapy ultrasonic therapy ultrasonic transducer arrays ipc-code A61B5/055 Involving electronic [emr] or nuclear [nmr] magnetic resonance, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging ipc-code A61N5/00 Radiation therapy ipc-code A61N7/00 Ultrasound therapy ipc-code B06B1/00 Processes or apparatus for generating mechanical vibrations of infrasonic, sonic or ultrasonic frequency ipc-code G01N33/48 Biological material, e.g. blood, urine; Haemocytometers 9502500 8794 Clin Cancer Res Clin.

These efforts have revealed new mechanisms of resistance and raise the possibility that known mechanisms may become even more relevant in the context of effective AR suppression. These mechanisms include tumoral appropriation of alternative androgen sources, alterations in AR expression, AR mutations, truncated AR variants, alterations and cross-talk in recruitment of co-factors to AR binding sites in the genome, and AR-driven oncogenic gene fusions. New agents such as enzalutamide, EPI-001, AR-specific peptidomimetics, novel HSP90 inhibitors and PARP inhibitors, as well as new approaches to co-targeting the AR pathway point to the potential for more complete and durable control of AR mediated growth. prostate cancer androgens androgen receptor Mol Cancer Mol.

An important clinical challenge in prostate cancer therapy is the inevitable transition from androgen-sensitive to castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer. Albeit the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis has been targeted, the biological mechanism underlying the lethal event of androgen independence remains unclear. New emerging evidences indicate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles during the development of castration-resistance and metastasis of prostate cancer. Notably, EMT may be a dynamic process. Castration can induce EMT that may enhance the stemness of CSCs, which in turn results in castration-resistance and metastasis. Reverse of EMT may attenuate the stemness of CSCs and inhibit castration-resistance and metastasis. These prospective approaches suggest that therapies target EMT and CSCs may cast a new light on the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in the future. Here we review recent progress of EMT and CSCs in CRPC. Castration-resistant Prostate cancer Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Cancer stem cells Signaling pathways Introduction Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths amongst males in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the mainstay therapy for advanced prostate cancer in addition to surgery. Many studies have been focused on androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Drugs targeting AR pathway have been developed in the past several decades, including estrogens (such as diethylstilbestrol, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone inhibitor), steroidal anti-androgens (such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate) and nonsteroidal antiandrogens (such as flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide, androgen receptor blockers), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (such as abarelix and degarelix). Although initially effective at regressing tumor growth, these androgen deprivation therapies will ultimately fail, rendering a lethal drug-resistant stage commonly known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The biological basis underlying the development of metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer has been addressed, mainly focusing on AR over-expression, mutation, and cross-talk to other growth factor signaling pathways [1]. Due to recognition of continued AR signaling in the progress of CRPC, several new drugs include MDV3100, abiraterone acetate and VN-124-1 have been investigated in clinical trials, and the former two drugs have been approved by US Food and Drug Administration last year. However, the potential mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells become CRPC still remain largely unclear. In recent years, accumulating evidences indicate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important roles during the development of drug resistance of prostate cancer. Unveiling the molecular mechanisms responsible for EMT and CSCs would help to develop new promising therapies for metastatic prostate cancer in the future. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding regarding EMT and CSCs in CRPC, including possible relationships between EMT and CSCs and specific signaling pathways involved during generation of EMT and CSCs (Figure 1). Figure 1 Contribution of EMT, CSC and related signaling to CRPC. Castration induces EMT and enhances the stemness of CSCs, which are the two key contributors for the development of castration resistance. Following castration, epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotypes, i.e., biomarkers such as E-cadherin, but gain mesenchymal characteristics or biomarkers such as N-cadherin and Zeb-1. Cancer stem cells are stem cell-like tumor cells, which have the capability of self-renewal and differentiation. Castration can enrich this population. Certain molecules might be regarded as prostate cancer stem cell markers, such as CD133, CD166, and etc. Specific signaling including Wnt, Notch, SHH, and others might be the underlying molecular basis of the functions of EMT and CSCs. The EMT appears to be a dynamic process. Development of drugs either inhibiting EMT, CSCs and specific signaling pathways or enhancing expression of epithelial cell markers might be a novel, additional strategy to treat CRPC in the future. (?, Promote; ?, Inhibit.) Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and castration-resistant prostate cancer EMT has been known to be involved in a spectrum of physiology and pathology process. Originally EMT is a physiological process in which epithelial cells turn into mesenchymal cells through a specific signaling pathway. Via EMT, epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotypes such as cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and gain mesenchymal characteristics such as high capability of migration, invasion, anti-apoptosis and disorganization of extracellular matrix. Prostate tumors are adenocarcinomas, arising originally from the glandular epithelium of the prostate gland and prostatic ductules. Castration can induce EMT [2], which might be a critical biological process for the malignant tumor cells of epithelial origin to leave the epithelium, invade into the stroma area, and disseminate to distal organs, as reported in recent studies [3-5]. Multiple proteins participate in EMT and its reverse process, MET (Mesenchymal-epithelial transition). A variety of biomarkers have been demonstrated for studies on EMT, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Zeb1, Twist and others [6]. Amongst them, E-cadherin locates in the cell surface of epithelial tissues and mediates cell-cell adhesion to bind cells together in the normal epithelial cells. Its expression level is negatively correlated with the occurrence of EMT and tumor invasion. On the contrary, Vimentin (a cytoskeletal marker) and N-cadherin (a cell surface marker) are associated with the initiation of EMT and the progression from well differentiated adenoma to invasive carcinoma. In addition, Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist are able to down-regulate the level of E-cadherin and drive EMT to occur [7]. Sun et al [2] have found that androgen deprivation results in EMT in the prostate cancer. Epithelial marker (e.g. E-cadherin) levels are decreased whereas mesenchymal marker (e.g. N-cadherin, Zeb1, Twist1, and Slug) expression is increased in normal mouse prostate tissue following castration. Similar changes are observed in castrated human LuCaP35 xenograft tumors. They also prove that an EMT occurs in human samples undergoing ADT. During the EMT transition, a mesenchymal marker Zeb1, a transcription factor, mediates the progress by Zeb1?AR feedback loop [2]. The evidence for Zeb1 to be involved in CRPC has also been supported by another group. Graham et al find that Zeb1 is markedly enhanced in prostate cancer cells and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is responsible for the overexpression of Zeb1 [8]. Twist, another transcription factor, is highly expressed in prostate cancer and twist expression is strongly associated with Gleason score. Blockade of Twist increases the level of E-cadherin and decreases the capability of invasion and migration of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells [9,10]. In addition, Slug, another EMT transcription factor, is regulated by androgen, cooperates with AR and promotes the development of CRPC [11]. Similarly, Reiter and colleagues have found a remarkable increase in N-cadherin expression in CRPC xenografts as well as in both primary and metastatic tumors of patients with CRPC [12]. Application of exogenous N-cadherin could induce EMT, invasion, migration of multiple prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Specific N-cadherin antibody could suppress the process of EMT, decrease tumor growth, invasion and migration, and block the progression to castration-resistance via reducing the activity of AKT and IL-8 expression. Therefore, this group has identified N-cadherin as a critical cause of prostate cancer metastasis and CRPC. It is proposed that therapies targeting this EMT component with monoclonal antibodies will be a promising approach for further preclinical and clinical validation. Meanwhile, several EMT biomarkers have been demonstrated to be associated with the development of prostate cancer in the last decade. Loss of E-cadherin or switch of E-cadherin to N-cadherin leads to destruction of cell-cell adhesion, which drives adenoma to become carcinoma [13]. As an osteoblast cadherin, Cadherin-11 could provide association between prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts, enhance the invasion and migration capacities [14]. Zinc-finger transcription factor Snail could not only repress the transcription and expression of E-cadherin but also trigger EMT in prostate cancer [15]. Although these molecules have been investigated for prostate cancer in general and not specific for CRPC, they might be potential candidates of EMT markers for CRPC. In short words, these studies together suggest that EMT and its biomarkers contribute to drug resistance in prostate cancer [16]. E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Zeb1, Twist, Slug, Snail and other EMT markers play important roles in the regulation of the invasive and metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, therapeutic strategies purporting to intervene EMT process or to reverse EMT phenotypes might become alternatives for future cancer therapy. Cancer stem cells and castration-resistant prostate cancer CSCs are proposed to be stem-like cells in tumors, which have the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into new diverse tumor cells. These cells are thought to be a subpopulation of the tumor cells that express specific surface antigens and possess mesenchymal phenotypes, which are important in tumor initiation and progression including castration resistance and metastasis. As an important mechanism in the de novo theory of CRPC, CSCs are referred to as malignant epithelial stem cells in the lurker cell pathway [1]. Very early, John Isaacs [17] has postulated that initial occurrence of a subpopulation of androgen-independent tumor cells can cause the fail of androgen ablation therapy and the development of CRPC. Denmeade and colleagues [18] reveal that the basal cells of prostate contain a subpopulation of androgen-independent epithelial stem cells. In support of this hypothesis, using a novel human prostate cancer xenograft (LAPC-9), Craft et al [19] have reported that the occurrence of CRPC attributed to clonal expansion of a small percentage of androgen-independent cells. They conclude that prostate cancers contain both androgen sensitive and insensitive cells and selective pressure of ADT alters the relative frequency of these cells, leading to development of CRPC. CSCs biomarkers are searched and used to identify and isolate CSCs in prostate cancer. Frequently used biomarkers in CRPC related CSCs include Nkx3.1, CD166, PSA-/LO, Nanog, Bmi-1 and Sox2 (Table 1). Other potential biomarkers contain Lgr4, Sca-1, ?2?1, CD44, CD44+/?2?1hi/CD133+, CD44+ CD24-, p63, Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+, Trop2, ALDH1 and others (Table 1). The features and related studies for each of the above mentioned markers are listed in Table 1.

For example, Shen and colleagues [20] have found that castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing positive cells (CARNs), a subpopulation of luminal epithelial cells, are CSCs in their study of lineage association between normal prostate progenitor cells and cancer cells. Basal cells decrease and luminal cells proliferate in the oncogenic formation. Compared with control Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Pten+/+ mice with normal phenotype, Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenflox/flox mice develop high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and carcinoma following inducible deletion of Pten in the Nkx3.1 population [20]. In addition to the homeobox-containing transcription factor Nkx3.1, some cell surface markers are always available for identifying CSCs in both murine and human prostate tissues. One of the surface markers, CD166, is identified as a potential surface marker for castration resistant tumor cells [21]. The level of CD166 increases in both murine castrated prostate epithelial cells and human CRPC. CD166hi population isolated by CD166 marker has higher capacity to form tumor-spheres, compared with CD166lo population. In addition, compared to TROP2hiCD49fhiCD166lo, TROP2hiCD49fhiCD166hi subset detects increased regeneration capacity in vivo. Over-expression of CD166 and CD166hi cells is correlated with castration resistance in both Pten deleted mice and human prostate cancer cells [21]. Interestingly, PSA?/lo prostate cancer cells are also demonstrated as an important cell type for CRPC [22]. Compared with PSA+ cells, PSA?/lo prostate cancer cells are more clonogenic and tumorigenic. They resist to castration, form holoclones and spheres and develop tumors. PSA?/lo prostate cancer cells are enriched following ADT and initiate a new outbreak of tumor development. A decrease in the number of PSA-producing cells is also observed by another group in patients after ADT [23]. Of note, a couple of pluripotent stem cell markers have also been associated with CRPC cells, further raising the possibility that stem cells play critical roles in the progression to a castration-resistant condition. For example, Nanog facilitates the tumor cells to acquire CSCs phenotypes and properties and promotes androgen independence in androgen deprived environment. LNCaP cells with over-expression of Nanog are easier to agglomerate together to form clones and spheres in vitro and lead to tumor in vivo following castration [24,25]. Similarly, Witte and colleagues have also reported that Bmi-1 mRNA level is enhanced in castrated mice prostate tissues and it maintains the stemness of p63+ stem cells. Suppression of Bmi-1 slows down the progression of malignant tumors in Pten-deletion prostate cancer model [26]. Moreover, a recent study shows that Sox2 is a critical regulator in self-renewal and tumor progression of human prostate cancer [27]. In addition, Sox2 could also be suppressed by AR and closely associated with castration-resistant tumor growth [28]. As many researchers believe that CSCs may arise from the gene mutations in normal stem cells, it is important to identify markers for stem cells in normal tissues. In this regard, a couple of stem cell markers are recently identified in normal prostates in addition to the above mentioned biomarkers in CRPC. Gao and colleagues have generated a functional prostate gland from Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+ stem cells [29]. Based on ?2?1, stem cells of human prostate epithelial are identified and isolated by Collins and colleagues [30]. A study from Burger et al indicates that prostate stem cell antigen Sca-1, a cell surface marker, is over-expressed in proximal regions of prostatic ducts. Sca-1 cells purified from the proximal ducts have higher capacity of proliferation [31]. Another recent study shows that Lgr4 regulates both prostate epithelial stem cell differentiation and prostate development [32]. Because the stemness of stem cells is linked to tumorigenesis, the cells expressing stem cell markers may be the origin for cancer. The finding of these stem cell markers in the development of prostate may provide a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Altogether, CSCs are considered to be a novel theory to elucidate the mechanism of surviving prostatic tumor cells following castration. The biomarkers of CSCs could be potential targets for treatment of castration-resistant tumor cells. In conjunction with ADT, novel therapeutics targeting CSCs, e.g. Nkx3.1+, CD166hi, TROP2hiCD49fhiCD166hi, TRA-1-60/CD151/CD166, PSA?/lo, Nanog, Bmi-1 cells, might be developed to eradicate remaining refractory tumor cells and to prevent recurrence of CRPC. Possible link between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells in castration-resistant prostate cancer Numerous studies have shown that EMT and CSCs are primary mechanisms for drug resistance in cancer including CRPC. Recently, a few studies have shown that characteristics of EMT are closely associated with the signatures of CSCs, which could lead to tumor recurrence and drug resistance phenotype. Mani et al [33] recently find the experimental evidence to connect EMT to the emergence of CSCs in breast cancer. They have demonstrated that after TGF-? treatment (a potential inducer of EMT), differentiated mammary epithelial cells give rise to CD44high CD24low stem-like cells, as is seen in the case of induced by the expression of well-known E-cadherin transcription repressors, such as Twist and Snail. Very importantly, a recent elegant study by Weinberg group indicates that Zeb1, a key EMT regulator, is sufficient to switch the cells from a non-cancer stem cell to a cancer stem cell status and is required for the maintenance of the stemness of breast cancer stem cells [34]. Similar phenomenon is observed in pancreatic cancer. ZEB1, a signature of EMT, suppresses miR-200c, miR-203 and miR-128, which inhibit pluripotency genes, such as the Bmi-1, Sox2 and Klf4 genes [35]. These studies have made a link between EMT and CSCs stemness in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer and raise a possibility that EMT and CSCs can contribute either alone or in conjunction with each other to the initiation and progression of various types of cancers, including prostate cancer. As expected, Kong et al [36] further report that PC3 prostate cancer cells which are forced to express PDGF-D display EMT characteristics and show cancer stem-like cell features after over-expression of pluripotency genes, such as the Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Lin28 and activation of polycomb repressor complex, which is associated with increased clonogenic and prostasphere-forming capacity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. During the process, miR-200b and miR-200c play a critical role in linking EMT phenotypes and CSCs signatures. Over-expression of miR-200 family leads to reversed EMT as well as suppressed self-renewal ability by regulating Notch1 and/or Lin28B expression [36]. Sun et al [2] have also presented the evidence that the association between EMT induction and the emergence of prostate CSC-like phenotype following androgen deprivation. By comparison of the gene expression profiles of the prostate tissues from normal mice to castrated mice, a dramatic decrease in E-cadherin expression and an induction of the expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin, Zeb1, Twist and slug are observed after castration. Microarray gene analysis reveals that several mesenchymal markers, including Vimentin, Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist1, Snail1 and Slug are significantly increased in the Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+ stem cells, as compared to those Lin-CD44-CD133-Sca-1-CD117- mouse prostate non-stem cells [2]. Therefore, in addition to the breast and pancreatic tissues, evidence from prostate cancer also indicate that androgen deprivation or other inducers may lead to an EMT phenotype accompanying with the acquisition of stem cell properties. Taken together, modulation of EMT may attenuate the stemness of CSCs. Signaling pathways involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells in castration-resistant prostate cancer Although EMT and CSC play a pivotal role in the development of CRPC, what mechanisms might be responsible for EMT or CSC-conferred castration resistance are not well understood. One key mechanism is likely related to the AR and AR signaling, a classic pathway leading to CRPC [1]. "
Prostate_Cancer "Besides the AR axis, the activation has also been presumed to be stimulated by some other pathways, such as growth-factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activated pathways, Pten related pathway, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) related pathway, Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways [37-41]. AR pathways The precise role of AR axis in CRPC and prostate cancer metastasis has been well recognized in the last decades. In addition to the commonly known AR amplification and AR mutant, recent studies have found that androgens and the androgen receptor are functionally required in the process of EMT and the maintenance of prostate stem/progenitor cells. To some extent, androgens can induce EMT in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, with reduced epithelial marker expression and increased level of mesenchymal marker. Androgens alone or in combination with TGF-? enhance the capacity of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, with a significant increase in Snail expression. Meanwhile, only low level of AR is required in androgen-induced EMT phenotype alteration [42]. Via a possible AR-Zeb1 bidirectional, negative feedback loop, Sun et al [2] have found that androgen deprivation could lead to EMT in both normal prostate and prostate cancer tissues. In addition, Slug, another EMT transcription factor, could cooperate with AR and promote the development of CRPC [11]. A recent study reveals that mucin 1 (MUC1) C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) could form a complex with AR, which could not only occupy the PSA promoter but also associate with induction of the EMT modulated by miR135b mediated [43] or ZEB1 mediated mechanism [44]. Moreover, MUC1-C overexpression in androgen sensitive LNCaP cell also increases cell growth following androgen depletion and anti-androgen (such as bicalutamide) treatment, implicating its role in the occurrence of CRPC. Furthermore, the methylation in CpG islands of AR promoter is likely related to prostate stem/progenitor cells stemness and differentiation. As a result, prostatic epithelial cells, PCSCs and LNCaP progenitor/stem cells present low AR expression due to high DNMT1/3 level and MBD2-AR promoter binding. Moreover, treatment of prostate cancer cells with 5-AZA, a specific DNA methylation inhibitor, results in an inhibition of self-renewal/growth of prostate stem/progenitor cells in vitro and reduces prostate tumorigenicity in vivo[45]. Growth-factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activated pathways Progression of prostate cancer to CRPC is also associated with enhanced expression of growth factors and receptors capable of activating the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways. Utilizing the androgen refractory carcinoma of the prostate (ARCaP) cell model, Graham et al investigated the effect of IGF-I on ZEB1 expression. The ARCaPM (M?=?mesenchymal) cells show higher expression of ZEB1 than the ARCaPE cells (E?=?epithelial). IGF-1 treatment up-regulates the mRNA and protein levels of ZEB1 in vitro via activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Furthermore, treatment of prostate cancer cells with ZEB1 siRNA results in a more epithelial morphology, with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin, fibronectin expression, and suppresses prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. These results together suggest that IGF-1 is a key regulator of EMT in prostate cancer, which induces cell invasion, metastasis and CRPC [8]. Using an inducible FGFR1 (iFGFR1) prostate mouse model, Acevedo et al have found that iFGFR1 activation by chemical inducers of dimerization (CID) results in prostate adenocarcinoma that is closely associated with EMT, while CID withdrawal causes a full reversion of PIN. iFGFR1-induced prostate cancer presents higher nuclear EMT-associated Sox9 expression and liver and lymph node metastases [38]. As a part of general signaling activities for most growth factor receptors, activation of endogenous c-Ras might be an important mechanism for CRPC. For example, induced RasN17 expression (a dominant negative form of Ras) in C4-2 cell line increases the sensitivity to Casodex (an anti-androgen drug), inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and causes a dramatic regression of C4-2 xenografts after surgical androgen ablation in vivo[46]. Pten related pathways Pten loss and the activation of Pten/PI3K/AKT have been well understood in prostate tumorgenesis and its progression to castration resistance, indicating that Pten related pathway may play an important role in CRPC. Higher level of p-MAPK is observed in malignant and CRPC prostate tissues than non-malignant specimens [37]. Using a series of prostate mouse models, Mulholland et al [37] have reported that in contrast to Pb-Cre+;PtenL/L and Pb-Cre+;K-rasL/W, prostate samples from Pb-Cre+;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants present an EMT phenotype, with increased expression of mesenchymal molecules including Vimentin, Fibronectin, Snail, Twist and Zeb1. Thus, activation of RAS may contribute to the development of EMT in Pten-deletion prostate epithelial cells. As it is mentioned above, recent studies show that EMT is mechanistically associated with the acquisition of cancer stem cells. The Pten;K-ras prostates, which also present a remarkable expansion of LSChi subpopulation, have enhanced sphere-forming ability compared to Pten deletion prostates. Further isolation by FACS show that only Lin-EpCAMlowCD24low cells from C+;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants gain mesenchymal properties accompanied by higher sphere-forming capacity. The EpCAMlow/CD24low subpopulation displays mesenchymal cells signatures, with enhanced level of AR and mesenchymal cell markers [37]. Therefore, activation of RAS/MAPK pathway may function as a second hit following changes of the well-known PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway to androgen-insensitive prostate cancer and CRPC [37]. STAT3 related pathway Comparing hormone-naive tissue samples with CRPC specimens, Rocchi et al [47] find that molecular chaperone Hsp27 mRNA and protein level are increased after ADT. Over-expression of Hsp27 in LNCaP cells displays highly resistance to anti-androgen reagents in vitro and in vivo. Compared with mock-transfected controls, tumor volume and serum PSA levels are dramatically increased after castration in LNCaP-Hsp27 tumors, suggesting that increased Hsp27 levels can promote the development of CRPC. Furthermore, treatment with Hsp27 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) or HSP27 shRNA can lead to an inhibited proliferation in LNCaP cells, induce apoptosis via inhibition of STAT3 activity in vitro and reduce the capacity of tumorgenesis after castration in vivo. These results have implied that Hsp27 might be a regulator of STAT3-induced apoptosis in the condition of androgen ablation and be a promising therapeutic target in CRPC [47]. Another report about Hsp27 from their lab indicates that Hsp27 over-expression can regulate EMT in prostate cancer, accompanied by a mesenchymal cell morphology switch. While Hsp27 promotes EMT with enhanced cell migration and invasion ability, silencing Hsp27 could reverse these EMT phenotypes, with reduced STAT3 phosphorylation and its binding to the Twist promoter. These observations suggest that instead of inducing apoptosis, Hsp27 also functions as a key regulator for IL-6�induced EMT via STAT3/Twist signaling pathway [39]. A recent study from Collins and colleagues has explored the contribution of STAT3 signaling pathway to prostate stem/progenitor cells [48]. Treatment with either specific IL-6 antibody or a specific pSTAT3 inhibitor (LLL12), leads to a reduced colony-forming capacity of the stem-like cells from a high-grade clinical prostate cancer sample. Using a murine xenograft model derived from a castration-resistant patient with generally activated STAT3, they found that cells from the xenografts show dramatically decreased tumorigenicity when treated with LLL12. These results suggest that blocking STAT3 might be a novel strategy in the future to suppress tumor initiation capability of human prostate cancer [48]. Wnt pathways In addition to the pathways mentioned above, alterations in the Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog pathways have also been reported to contribute to formation of CRPC. Based on ?-catenin immunocytochemical analysis, Wan et al [49] have revealed the functional role of Wnt/?-catenin in CRPC. In their study, high levels of ?-catenin is observed in human prostate cancer tissues, which is inversely linked with AR expression, raising the possibility that low or no AR expression activates Wnt/?-catenin signaling. This evidence may explain the phenomenon that only low level of AR lead to androgen-induced EMT phenotype [42]. A recent study reports that Sox2 promotes EMT via activation of WNT/?-catenin, with improved migration and metastasis ability in vitro and in vivo. Over-expression of Sox2 in human breast cell line-MDA231 and human prostate cancer cell line DU145 causes enhanced migration capacity and decreased levels of E-cadherin, DKK3 and increased a-SMA, DVL1 and DVL3. Further experiments indicate that Sox2 promotes EMT via binding to the promoter of ?-catenin [50]. Additional studies find that the promoter of WIF1 (a WNT inhibitor) is hypermethylated, resulting in its down-regulation in most prostate cancer cell lines [51]. Consistent with the WIF1 over-expression experiments, restoration of WIF1 by treating the cells with 5-Aza induces MET, a reverse process of EMT, with upregulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, CK8/18), down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Fibronectin, Vimentin, Slug and Twist) and decreased activity of MMP-2/9 in vitro. Meanwhile, over-expression of WIF1 dramatically reduces tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model, accompanied by an increased E-cadherin and CK18 expression and a decreased vimentin level in tumor tissues [51]. Moreover, WNT inhibitors reduce the sphere-forming and self-renewal ability of prostate cancer cells. The opposite results are observed when the cells are treated with WNT3a, with an increased expression of ?-catenin, CK18, CD133 and CD44 [51]. Therefore, WNT signaling affects the functions of CSCs [40]. Notch and hedgehog pathways As an important regulator of cell fate determination, Notch signaling is reported to play crucial roles not only in prostate development but also in the progression of prostate cancer. Recent studies have suggested that Notch pathway elements are positively participated in both normal and malignant prostate stem/progenitor cells [52]. Similar to this observation, inactivation of Notch1 dramatically suppresses the clonogenic and prostasphere forming ability, implying that Notch1 is at least partially responsible for maintaining the prostate stem/progenitor cells. Expression of Notch1 is reported to be mediated by miR-200b and miR-200c, which links CSCs signatures with EMT phenotypes. However, further studies are required to unveil whether other Notch pathway elements regulate cancer stem/initiating cell within the prostate [36]. It has been well established that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays central roles in developmental patterning and regeneration of prostate epithelium. Treatment with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of the Hh pathway, suppresses tumor growth at 10 mg/kg and actual regression at 50 mg/kg in established PC3 and 22RV1 xenograft tumors in vivo[41]. Moreover, cyclopamine suppresses transcription of the gene encoding nestin and the Polycomb group protein Bmi-1, two stem cell markers, indicating the role of Hh pathway activity in prostate progenitor cells. Using the castration-regeneration cycle model, Hh signaling pathway blockade by cyclopamine leads to loss of regenerative capacity in rodent ventral prostates. Examination of levels of Hh pathway targets PTCH and GLI in metastatic and benign prostate tissues shows that Hh pathway activity is strongly correlated with prostate cancer metastasis, which is attributed to the involvement of EMT [41]. Taken together, these results suggest that all the pathways mentioned above can either function alone or in combination with each other during prostate cancer progression. The advanced CRPC is linked with EMT and/or CSCs, revealing a possible mechanism in the transition of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent state. Drugs designed to target these pathways may provide a promising direction for the future treatment of CRPC. Regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition activity, stemness of cancer stem cells and specific signaling pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer After recognizing the importance of EMT, CSCs and related signaling pathways during the development of CRPC, what we should do is to find a way to control these elements by either reversing or inhibiting the activation of these components so to prevent or alleviate CRPC. Studies thus so far suggest that inhibition of any one of these elements or multiple elements together are helpful in alleviation of CRPC. A promising example is the study on N-cadherin and N-cadherin antibodies. As described above, Reiter and colleagues have reported that N-cadherin could cause metastasis and castration resistance of prostate cancer, but antibodies blocking N-cadherin not only delay the progression of prostate cancer to castration resistance but also inhibit invasion, metastasis and castration-resistant tumor growth in vitro and in vivo[12]. These data warrants that N-cadherin antibodies be validated in preclinical and clinical testing to determine their general toxicity. Therefore, antibodies directly against cell surface markers of EMT and/or CSCs might be a reasonable way to control EMT and CRPC. Another way to control EMT would be to use its related proteins and pathways. OGX-427, which currently in phase II trials by OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, is another great example. Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) induces IL-6 dependent and independent EMT in prostate cancer by promoting phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, making STAT3 to bind to the Twist promoter, and activating Twist function. Shut down of Hsp27 reverses EMT and decreases migration, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase activity of prostate cancer cells. As an anti-sense inhibitor, OGX-427 suppresses Hsp27 and reduces circulating tumor cells and tumor metastasis [39]."
Prostate_Cancer "Another group also reports that regulators of EMT have a good effect on several types of cancers (ovarian, nasopharyngeal and esophageal carcinomas), especially in prostate cancer [53]. Chu and colleagues have applied two water-soluble contents of garlic, S-allylcysteine (SAC) and S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), to suppress proliferation and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer. The inhibitory effect appears to be due to the reverse of EMT: mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). During the reverse transition, E-cadherin is restored and activated whereas Snail expression is decreased in prostate cancer cells [53]. One more evidences of targeting EMT is the study of NPI-0052 by Baritaki and colleagues [54]. They show that the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 reverses castration resistance to androgen sensitive via inhibiting EMT in human prostate cancer cell lines. NPI-0052 regulates NF-?B-Snail-RKIP pathway by suppressing NF-?B inhibition, down-regulating the EMT biomarker Snail, and up-regulating Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). Snail is a crucial target for reversal of resistance. Further experiments indicate that administration of NPI-0052 leads to inhibit anti-apoptotic gene and metastasis [15,54]. On the other hand, molecules targeting cancer stem cells are investigated. Liu and colleagues have demonstrated miR-34a as a potential therapeutic target against prostate cancer stem cells [55]. CD44+ prostate cancer cells are purified from xenografts in mice and primary tumors in humans as prostate CSCs. They display enhanced tumor proliferating and metastatic capacities in CD44+ population. MiR-34a is down-regulated in the CD44+ cells. Up-regulation of miR-34a leads to an inhibition of sphere formation and tumor progression in prostate cancer cells and in CD44+ cell. The study of miR-34a indicates that a critical negative regulator of CSCs could be an attractive therapeutic option in prostate cancer with a cancer origin of stem cells. Similarly, another negative regulator of prostate cancer stem cells is identified by Kroon and colleagues [48]. They demonstrate that pSTAT3 is expressed specially in prostate stem-like and progenitor cells with co-expression of IL-6 receptor gp80. If LLL12, a novel pSTAT3 inhibitor, is applied to prevent STAT3 from phosphorylation, the stemness of prostate cancer cells is inihibited, resulting in significant reduction of cancer cell proliferation in primary cultures from patients with high Gleason grades. Strikingly, blocking pSTAT3 by LLL12 also abolishes the outgrowth of castrated tumors from patients in a mouse xenograft model. In addition, targeting the STAT3 pathway in prostate CSCs might be a promising therapeutic way by another group. Hellsten and colleagues [56] find that ALDH?+?prostate cancer cells are cancer stem cell-like cells as they display the properties of CSCs such as self-renew, clonogenicity and tumorigenicity as well as elevated expression of CD44 and integrin ?2?1, two CSCs markers, and pSTAT3. Besides galiellalactone, a direct inhibitor of STAT3 pathway, in the culture medium, suppresses proliferation of ALDH?+?cells. These findings emphasize that targeting CSCs in prostate cancer is a considerable therapeutic approach. In addition to directly target EMT and CSC, potential therapies targeting signaling pathways related to EMT and CSC are also investigated. Mulholland and colleagues apply mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and MEK inhibitor PD325901 to target the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling in an in vivo prostate cancer model using a bioluminescence image monitoring method. The combined treatment decreases EMT phenotypes, cell proliferation, and metastasis of the C+;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W; Rosa26-luc sphere cells to the lung or the metastasis produced by stem/progenitor cells purified from C+;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W transgenic mice [37]. It is widely believed that castration enriches stem/progenitor cells in the prostate. Using the castration and androgen replacement prostate regeneration paradigm, Hh pathway blockade by cyclopamine or Hh-neutralizing 5E1 antibody dramatically attenuates prostate regeneration [41], implying that these Hh pathway inhibitors impede the function of prostate stem cells. Conclusions In summary, castration resistance is a major clinic problem. In addition to the classic AR signaling, recent studies have present a large body of evidence that EMT [57-75], CSCs [76-86] and specific signaling [87-104] play important roles during the development of CRPC. Initial experiments also suggest that there is a link between EMT and CSCs. EMT appears to be a 2-way dynamic process. It is proposed that while EMT may enhance the stemness of CSCS and enhance the CRPC, reversing the EMT or MET may attenuate the stemness of CSCs and alleviate CRPC. Further studies will reveal more molecular mechanisms involved in CRPC. It is also possible that these mechanisms can function either alone or in combination with each other. Nevertheless, focusing on the axis of EMT, CSCs and specific signaling pathways is a novel, breakthrough thinking in the war against CRPC. Among them, development of antibodies against the surface biomarkers including those EMT markers such as N-cadherin, CSC markers such as CD133, and specific signaling molecule such as HSP27 is the easier approach than targeting the transcription factors or cytoplasmic molecules and might hold promise for a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. Clinical trials of molecules in these categories to rule out toxicity and to demonstrate efficacy are required to achieve this goal.

Prostate_Cancer "Purpose To examine the role of body mass index (BMI) in assessment of prostate cancer (PCa) risk. Materials and Methods 3,258 participants who underwent biopsy (including 1,902 men with a diagnosis of PCa) were identified from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. The associations of BMI with PCa and high-grade PCa (HGPCa) were examined using logistic regression, adjusting for age, race, BMI-adjusted prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal exam, family history of PCa, previous biopsy history, PSA velocity and time between study entry and the last biopsy. The prediction models were compared with our previously-developed BMI-adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer Risk Calculator (bmiPCPTRC). Results Of the study subjects, 49.1% were overweight and 29.3% were obese. After adjustment, among men without a known family history of PCa, increased BMI was not associated with higher risk of PCa (per one-unit increase in logBMI: OR=0.83, p=0.54) but was significantly associated with higher risk of HGPCa (i.e., Gleason score?7 prostate cancer) (OR=2.31, p=0.03). For men with a known family history of PCa, the risks of PCa and HGPCa increased rapidly as BMI increased (PCa: OR=3.73, p=0.02; HGPCa: OR=7.95, p=0.002). The bmiPCPTRC generally underestimated the risks of PCa and HGPCa. Conclusions BMI provided independently predictive information regarding risks of PCa and HGPCa, after adjusting for other risk factors. BMI, especially among men with a known family history of PCa, should be considered for inclusion in any clinical assessment of PCa risk and recommendations regarding prostate biopsy. prostate cancer PSA BMI BMI-adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer Risk Calculator (bmiPCPTRC) high-grade prostate cancer 9302957 8479 Support Care Cancer Support Care Cancer Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer 0941-4355 1433-7339 24337765 3969757 10.1007/s00520-013-2092-0 NIHMS549444 Article Patterns and predictors of symptom incongruence in older couples coping with prostate cancer Winters-Stone Kerri M. 1 2 Lyons Karen S. 1 2 Bennett Jill A. 1 2 Beer Tomasz M. 2 1School of Nursing, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239 2Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239 Corresponding author: Kerri M.

If PCSs and spouses differ in their perceptions of symptoms, that incongruence may cause mismanagement of symptoms and reduced relationship quality. The purpose of this study was to examine symptom incongruence and identify the PCS and spouse characteristics associated with symptom incongruence in older couples coping with prostate cancer. Methods: Participants in the study were older PCSs (>60 yrs) and their spouses (N=59 couples). Symptom incongruence was determined by comparing patient and spouse independent ratings of the severity of his cancer-related symptoms. Predictor variables included PCS age, time since diagnosis, PCS comorbidity, PCS and spouse depressive symptoms, and spouse caregiving strain. Results: PCS and spouse ratings of his symptom severity and the amount of incongruence over his symptoms varied significantly across couples. Overall, couples rated a moderate level of PCS symptom severity, but PCSs and their spouses significantly differed in their perceptions of PCS symptom severity with spouses rating severity higher (t = ?2.66, df =51, p < 0.01). PCS younger age and high spouse caregiver strain accounted for 29% of incongruence in perceptions of PCS symptom severity. Conclusions: This study is among the first to show that PCSs and spouses may perceive cancer-related persistent symptoms differently. Among this older sample, younger PCS age and spouse caregiver strain were associated with incongruence in symptoms perceptions in couples. These and other factors may inform future interventions aimed at preserving relationship quality in older couples who have experienced prostate cancer. relationship survivorship quality of life supportive care depression 8101368 6523 Prostate Prostate The Prostate 0270-4137 1097-0045 25252079 4322001 10.1002/pros.22871 NIHMS614053 Article 8q24 Risk Alleles and Prostate Cancer in African-Barbadian Men Cropp Cheryl D. 1 6 Robbins Christiane M. 2 6 Sheng Xin 3 Hennis Anselm J.M. 4 Carpten John D. 2 Waterman Lyndon 4 Worrell Ronald 4 Schwantes-An Tae-Hwi 1 Trent Jeffrey M. 2 Haiman Christopher A. 3 Leske M.

Several genetic association studies have implicated select 8q24 loci in PRCA risk in AA. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the association between previously reported 8q24 risk alleles and PRCA in African-Barbadian (AB) men known to have high rates of PRCA. METHODS Ten previously reported candidate tag SNPs were genotyped and/or imputed in the 8q24 region in 532 AB men with PRCA and 513 AB controls from the Prostate Cancer in a Black Population (PCBP) study. RESULTS Rs2124036 was significant in AB men, (OR = 2.7, 95% CI (1.3�5.3), P=0.005, Empirical (max(T), corrected for multiple testing) P = 0.03) for the homozygous C/C genotype. Only a single SNP from this region remained statistically significant in our analysis of our AB population. These results may indicate the presence of a founder effect or due to the chosen SNPs not tagging an ancestral haplotype bearing the 8q24 risk allele(s) in this population or could reflect inadequate power to detect an association. We conducted a meta-analysis including our AB population along with two additional African Caribbean populations from Tobago and Jamaica for SNPs rs16901979 and rs1447295. Meta-analysis results were most significant for rs16901979 A allele (Z score 2.73; p=0.006) with a summary OR= 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09�1.58). CONCLUSIONS Additional studies are needed to provide deeper genotype coverage to further interrogate the 8q24 region to understand its contribution to PRCA in this population. 7603616 4036 Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys Int.

All rights reserved. 2014 Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of combining oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy (OAMCGT) with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Methods and Materials Forty-four men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive either OAMCGT plus IMRT (arm 1; n=21) or IMRT only (arm 2; n=23). The primary phase 2 endpoint was acute (?90 days�) toxicity. Secondary endpoints included quality of life (QOL), prostate biopsy (12-core) positivity at 2 years, freedom from biochemical/clinical failure (FFF), freedom from metastases, and survival. Results Men in arm 1 exhibited a greater incidence of low-grade influenza-like symptoms, transaminitis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia than men in arm 2. There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal or genitourinary events or QOL between the two arms. Two-year prostate biopsies were obtained from 37 men (84%). Thirty-three percent of men in arm 1 were biopsy-positive versus 58% in arm 2, representing a 42% relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm (P=.13). There was a 60% relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm in men with <50% positive biopsy cores at baseline (P=.07). To date, 1 patient in each arm exhibited biochemical failure (arm 1, 4.8%; arm 2, 4.3%). No patient developed hormone-refractory or metastatic disease, and none has died from prostate cancer. Conclusions Combining OAMCGT with IMRT does not exacerbate the most common side effects of prostate radiation therapy and suggests a clinically meaningful reduction in positive biopsy results at 2 years in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

We, therefore, test the hypothesis that supplementing general anaesthesia with neuraxial analgesia improves long-term oncological outcomes in patients having radical prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma. Methods Patients who had general anaesthesia with neuraxial analgesia (n=1642) were matched 1:1 based on age, surgical year, pathological stage, Gleason scores, and presence of lymph node disease with those who had general anaesthesia only. Medical records were reviewed."
Prostate_Cancer "Outcomes of interest were systemic cancer progression, recurrence, prostate cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. Data were analysed using stratified proportional hazards regression, the Kaplan�Meier method, and log-rank tests. The median follow-up was 9 yr. Results After adjusting for comorbidities, positive surgical margins, and adjuvant hormonal and radiation therapies within 90 postoperative days, general anaesthesia only was associated with increased risk for systemic progression [hazard ratio (HR)=2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31�6.05; P=0.008] and higher overall mortality (HR=1.32, 95% CI 1.00�1.74; P=0.047). Although not statistically significant, similar findings were observed for the outcome of prostate cancer deaths (adjusted HR=2.2, 95% CI 0.88�5.60; P=0.091). Conclusions This large retrospective analysis suggests a possible beneficial effect of regional anaesthetic techniques on oncological outcomes after prostate surgery for cancer; however, these findings need to be confirmed (or refuted) in randomized trials. anaesthesia, general analgesia, epidural, spinal cancer progression neoplasm metastasis prostatectomy prostatic neoplasms Mol Cell Biol Mol.

All Rights Reserved. 2015 American Society for Microbiology JUN transcription factors bind DNA as part of the AP-1 complex, regulate many cellular processes, and play a key role in oncogenesis. The three JUN proteins (c-JUN, JUNB, and JUND) can have both redundant and unique functions depending on the biological phenotype and cell type assayed. Mechanisms that allow this dynamic switching between overlapping and distinct functions are unclear. Here we demonstrate that JUND has a role in prostate cell migration that is the opposite of c-JUN�s and JUNB's. RNA sequencing reveals that opposing regulation by c-JUN and JUND defines a subset of AP-1 target genes with cell migration roles. cis-regulatory elements for only this subset of targets were enriched for ETS factor binding, indicating a specificity mechanism. Interestingly, the function of c-JUN and JUND in prostate cell migration switched when we compared cells with an inactive versus an active RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. We show that this switch is due to phosphorylation and activation of JUND by ERK. Thus, the ETS/AP-1 sequence defines a unique gene expression program regulated by the relative levels of JUN proteins and RAS/ERK signaling. This work provides a rationale for how transcription factors can have distinct roles depending on the signaling status and the biological function in question. 7600053 2780 Cancer Lett Cancer Lett.

For the first time, we recently succeeded in establishing and serially passaging spheroid cultures of several LuCaP xenografts. Here, we characterized in depth the molecular and cellular phenotype of LuCaP 147 cultures and found faithful retention of the characteristics of the original xenograft, including immunophenotype, genetic fidelity, gene expression profile and responsiveness to androgen. Furthermore, we demonstrated capabilities for high-throughput drug screening and that anti-cancer agents induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in spheroid cultures. Finally, we showed that cells formed tumors when re-introduced into mice, providing an authentic in vitro - in vivo preclinical model of a subtype of prostate cancer with a hypermutator phenotype and an SPOP mutation.

Background AZD3514 inhibits and down regulates the androgen receptor (AR) and has undergone clinical trials in prostate cancer. To provide proof-of-mechanism (POM) in patients, an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method for determination of AR in circulating tumour cells (CTC) was developed and validated. Methods After an assessment of specificity validation focused on intra- and inter-operator reproducibility utilising a novel modification of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR). ?-Content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (BCTI) and Cohen�s Kappa (?) were employed in statistical analysis of results. Results In a first set of IHC reproducibility experiments, almost perfect agreement was recorded (?=0.94) when two different operators scored CTC as overall positive or negative for AR. However, BCTI analysis identified a specific bias in scoring staining intensity, where one operator favoured moderate over strong assignments, whereas the reverse was the case with the second operator. After a period of additional training involving deployment of a panel of standardised images, a second set of validation experiments were conducted. These showed correction of the inter-operator bias by BCTI with ? for scoring intensity increasing from 0.59 to 0.81, indicative of almost perfect agreement. Conclusions By application of BCTI to the validation of IHC, operator bias and therefore poor reproducibility can be identified, characterised and corrected to achieve a level of error normally associated with a quantitative biomarker assay, such as an ELISA.

Prostate_Cancer "The methodological approach described herein can be applied to any generic IHC technique. AZD3514 Immunohistochemistry Method validation Incurred sample reanalysis Cohen�s Kappa ?-Content ?-confidence tolerance intervals Background The androgen receptor (AR) axis is a major effector in the development and progression of prostate cancer and an important target in the rational drug design of new anticancer agents [1]. Prior to interaction with ligand (principally 5?-dihydrotestosterone, testosterone and androstenedione) the AR is localised in the cytoplasm bound to heat shock proteins and remains pre-dominantly inactive [2,3]. Upon binding of an androgen the receptor dissociates from heat shock proteins and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to androgen response elements located in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes, resulting eventually in the formation of an active transcription complex after recruitment of co-regulatory proteins [2,3]. AZD3514 [6-(4-{4-[2-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenyl}piperidin-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydro [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine] emerged as the preferred clinical candidate from an extensive programme of rational drug design aimed at identifying small molecule inhibitors of the AR [4,5]. The drug has been shown to work by binding to the AR with high affinity, preventing nuclear translocation of the protein and inhibiting ligand-dependent and independent transcriptional activity [4,6]. Unique to AZD3514 as a pharmacological modulator is its ability to down regulate the protein both in vitro and in vivo [6] and its anti-proliferative activity against Dunning R3327H prostate tumours in rats correlated to a reduction in AR levels in tumour tissue [6]. Also, activity of this class of drug is significantly enhanced in animal models by castration. Therefore, AZD3514 entered phase I trials as an oral agent in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [7]. During the phase I trial of AZD3514 (EudraCT 2010-020232-19, NCT01162395), detection and enumeration of circulating tumour cells (CTC) pre- and post-administration by the CellSearch System [8] was the major focus of the pharmacodynamic assessment of the drug [7]. Several previous studies have demonstrated that pre-dose CTC numbers around a cut-off value of 5 per 7.5 ml of blood are prognostic of outcome in CRPC (where???5 predicts for bad prognosis) [9-11]. Thus, CTC were incorporated primarily as a surrogate marker of the anti-tumour activity of AZD3514. In the present study an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method has been developed for the determination of AR expression in CTC and subject to assay validation for potential application to the clinical evaluation of AZD3514. CTC were harvested from blood samples collected from the Astra Zeneca Sponsored Clinical Study (D1330N00013) by an approach termed Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumour Cells (ISET), which lends itself more readily to IHC than the CellSearch System [12]. After an initial evaluation of specificity, validation studies focused on reproducibility [13,14], where advanced statistical techniques, as recently applied to the validation of CTC enumeration by CellSearch, were employed in the analysis of data [15]. Methods Collection of patient samples Whole blood samples (minimum of 10 ml) were collected from 8 different patients entered into the Astra Zeneca sponsored clinical study D1330N00013: A Methodology Study to Assess the Variability of and Effect of Hormone Therapy on (i) Putative Androgen Regulated Gene Expression in Hair Samples and (ii) Circulating Tumour Cell Numbers and Androgen Receptor Expression in Patients with Prostate Cancer. The male subjects were from either Group 1 with localised prostate cancer with no hormonal treatment or Group 2 with locally advanced/metastatic prostate cancer on castration treatment and their characteristics are reported in Table  1. Table 1 Characteristics of subjects entered into the Astra Zeneca sponsored clinical study D1330N00013 whose blood samples where utilised in the present study Patient Age (Median) Performance status (Who) Stage Grade (Gleason) Baseline PSA (Median, ng/ml) Group I 71 Normal-Restricted Activity Localised Intermediate (5�7) 7.0 Group II 74 Normal-Restricted Activity Locally Advanced/ Metastatic High (8�10) 23.2 Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the studies were ethically approved by the North West 6 Research Ethics Committee (REC) - Greater Manchester South (Northwest Centre for Research Ethics Committees, 3rd Floor - Barlow House, 4 Minshull Street, Manchester M1 3DZ, UK) and the Declaration of Helsinki Principles was followed. The REC reference number for the study was 10/H1013/13. Specimens were obtained by venipuncture into EDTA tubes, stored at 4�C and processed within 4 hr by ISET as described below. Isolation by size of epithelial tumour cells Isolation of CTC from whole blood by the ISET technique was performed according to the manufacturer�s instructions (Rarecells SAS, Paris, France; formerly Metagenex) [12]. Prior to filtration red blood cells were lysed in MetaBuffer (containing 0.8% formaldehyde, Rarecells, 1:10 v/v). Filtration was then conducted through polycarbonate membranes containing 8 ?m pores utilising a 10 place vacuum system (Metablock, Rarecells). Thus, each 10 ml sample yielded 10 individual filter spots, which were stored at ?20�C prior to staining for the AR by IHC. Immunohistochemistry of the androgen receptor in circulating tumour cells In order to determine the level of AR expression in CTC, ISET filters were analysed by IHC as briefly detailed below. Each individual ISET filter was attached by a paper clip to a glass slide for further handling. Filters were rehydrated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). All steps were conducted at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Antigen retrieval of samples was conducted in a water bath at 99�C for 40 min in the presence of 250 ml antigen retrieval solution (catalogue number S1699, DAKO, Cambridge, UK). Next, the filters were washed in TBS and incubated with permeabilisation buffer (0.2% triton in TBS) for 10 min. Spots were then placed on a clean side and incubated with peroxidase block (3% hydrogen peroxidase in methanol) for 30 min, after which they were washed in water. Spots were again transferred to a clean slide and incubated overnight with anti-androgen receptor antibody (clone AR441, DAKO at 1:400 in DAKO antibody diluent) in a humidity chamber at 4�C. After incubation with antibody, filters were washed twice in TBS followed by a wash in water. Filters were then placed on a clean slide, Anti-Mouse EnVision?+?Dual Link System-HRP (DAKO) was added to each filter, which was then incubated for 1 hr after which they were washed twice in TBS. Filters were stained for 10 min with DAKO Liquid DAB?+?Substrate Chromogen System for 10 min after which they were washed in water. Filters were counter stained with CytoBlue (Innovex Biosciences, Richom, CA, USA) and finally mounted using Faramount (DAKO). Filters were scanned on the Bioview Allegro� Plus Scanner (Bioview, Rehovot, Israel) in brightfield mode, covering the entire area of the 0.6 cm diameter spot (scan area was set at 0.7 cm diameter). This scan area was then presented digitally as multiple image frames, from which CTCs could be selected. The brown staining intensity representing the level of AR expression was graded by the analyst as follows: negative, 1+???weak, 2++???moderate, 3+++???strong. Characterisation of the specificity of the ISET/immunohistochemistry methodology for the androgen receptor utilising cells lines treated with AZD3514 AZD3514 was received as a kind gift from Astra Zeneca (Oncology iMED, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, UK) and used as received. LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, LGC Standards, Teddington, UK) and cultured according to ATCC recommendations in RPMI medium 1640 containing foetal bovine serum. Prior to drug treatment, LNCaP cells were cultured for 24 hr in phenol-red free RPMI (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK) with 10% charcoal stripped foetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). The cells were then incubated for 24 hr with 10 ?M AZD3514 in 1% DMSO vehicle or vehicle alone as a control. After drug treatment the cells were harvested. Whole blood for spiking with cell lines was donated by healthy human volunteers according to an ethically approved protocol (North West 6 Research Ethics Committee). Blood was spiked with either LNCaP cells prior to incubation with AZD3514 (positive control), LNCaP cells post drug treatment or PC3 cells as a negative control and were then processed by ISET and stained for AR by IHC, as described above. Statistical methods Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) In order to evaluate the degree of inter-operator agreement in the assignment of a staining intensity to each CTC Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated using GraphPad QuickCalcs (San Diego, CA, USA) based on formula 1 below [16]. (1) ? = Pr a ? Pr e 1 ? Pr e Here, Pr(a) is the relative observed agreement among operators, and Pr(e) is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement, obtained using the observed data to calculate the probabilities of each observer randomly assigning each category. ?-Content ?-confidence tolerance intervals Agreement in the staining intensity assigned by different operators was also calculated as a measure of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) utilising ?-content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (BCTI). This statistic yields an upper and lower interval where a specified (?) proportion of measurements will lie with a specified (?) level of confidence and was calculated as previously reported [17]. In our adaptation of this methodology, where normally a single operator assays the same samples twice, data from a pair of operators who assayed the same samples a single time were substituted into the calculations, as described in full detail recently [15]. Calculation of BCTI was performed utilising MATLAB (Version R2009a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) at ??=?67% and 95% [18]. A plot of BCTI (y-axis) against IHC score (x-axis) represents a modified form of the �accuracy profile�. Results Specificity of the ISET/IHC technique for the AR in CTC was investigated employing, as controls, human prostate cancer cell lines of known AR status, together with treatment of cells with AZD3514 in order to modulate the levels of the protein. The positive control AR expressing cell line was LNCaP while the negative control was PC3. AR status was confirmed in these cell lines by Western blot analysis utilising the same antibody (AR441) as that employed in the IHC method through the presence of a band at 110 kDa in LNCaP and the absence of a band in PC3 (Inset to Figure  1), in keeping with previously published studies [19]. Figure  1 illustrates the results obtained from a typical ISET/IHC experiment, where blood from healthy volunteers was spiked with either untreated LNCaP cells, PC3 cells or LNCaP cells incubated with AZD3514 at a dose shown to reduce AR protein expression in this cell line [6]. Untreated LNCaP cells - the positive control - demonstrated strong nuclear brown staining for (translocated) AR, whereas the PC3 cells - the negative control - displayed a complete absence of brown staining. The almost complete absence of cytoplasmic staining in LNCaP cells may be due to constitutive autocrine stimulation of the AR signaling pathway [20]. In addition, in LNCaP cells pre-treated with AZD3514 prior to spiking into blood there was a marked reduction in the level of nuclear staining. These data indicate that the ISET/IHC method described herein can distinguish between AR positive and AR negative cancer cells in the blood of human subjects and is also sufficiently sensitive to detect a drug induced (pharmacodynamic) knockdown in protein levels. Figure 1 Characterisation of the specificity of the ISET/immunohistochemistry methodology for the androgen receptor utilising cells lines as controls. Specificity was investigated by employing human prostate cancer cell lines of known AR status, together with treatment of cells with AZD3514 in order to modulate the levels of the protein, to spike volunteer blood samples prior to processing by ISET and analysis by IHC. Untreated LNCaP cells were the positive control and demonstrated strong brown nuclear staining for AR. PC3 cells were the negative control and displayed a complete absence of brown staining. LNCaP cells pre-treated for 24 hours with 10 ?M AZD3514 prior to spiking into blood demonstrated a marked reduction in the level of nuclear staining, compared to untreated LNCaP cells. Inset: Western blot analysis of LNCaP and PC3 cells for androgen receptor protein expression. Loading was normalised by the addition of 20 ?g of protein to each lane and the blot was run according the standard western blot protocols, utilising anti-androgen receptor antibody clone AR441 as the primary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection for visualisation of bands. The major focus of the present study was to characterise between-operator and within-operator variability, employing multiple blood samples collected from either different patients or at different time points in the same patient. The number of CTCs captured in the different ISET filter spots ranged from 0 to 30 per ml of blood, within the range of CTC previously reported in prostate cancer patients [21]. In the first validation experiment 4 spots from 8 different patient blood samples were stained by IHC for AR expression and presented blindly to two different operators to both enumerate the CTC and score the staining intensity of each cell. The degree of inter-operator agreement was assessed both as a percentage and as ? and is presented in Table  2. Although Cohen's kappa coefficient is a statistical measure of inter-operator agreement for qualitative (categorical) items the ? statistic is not a test of significance. Nonetheless, it is a robust measure since it takes into account random agreement occurring by chance. Guidelines have been published to aid in the interpretation of ? [22], and these have been previously applied to the enumeration of CTC by CellSearch [23]. Significantly, almost perfect agreement was observed when the two different operators scored CTC as overall positive or negative for AR, with a ? value of 0.94. However, when the scores produced by different operators for staining intensity were analysed there was a large reduction in ? from 0.94 to 0.59, indicating a significant degree of disagreement. Table 2 Degree of inter-operator agreement in scoring of CTC for expression of the androgen receptor by immunohistochemistry   1 st Run 2 nd Run Evaluation Kappa1 % Agreement Kappa % Agreement Positive v Negative2 0.94 97.2 0.98 98.9 Staining intensity3 0.59 75.0 0.81 87.9 1Kappa values where calculated as described in Methods where the agreement between operators is defined as follows: < 0 none, 0�0.20 slight, 0.21�0.40 fair, 0.41�0.60 moderate, 0.61�0.80 substantial, and 0.81�1 almost perfect [22]. 2This table entry refers to an overall assessment of the level of positive versus negative staining regardless of the staining intensity. 3Staining intensity was graded into 4 categories as negative, weak (1 +), moderate (2 ++) or strong (3 +++). ?-Content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (BCTI) reports on ISR both in the form of precision/imprecision and trueness/bias. Figure  2 illustrates the accuracy profiles at both 67% and 95% probability for the staining intensity assignments of two operators. These demonstrate a relatively large degree of imprecision, as might be expected with categorical data. However, they also highlight a significant bias, where operator 1 favoured a score of 2++ (moderate staining intensity) over 3+++ (strong), whereas operator 2 favoured 3+++ over 2++. Such a bias would not be evident by ? alone. Figure 2 Characterisation of inter-operator variability in AR staining intensity by IHC in CTC harvested from patient samples by ISET. ISET membrane spots obtained after filtration of a number of different patient blood samples were stained by IHC for AR expression and presented blindly to two different analysts to both enumerate the CTC and score the staining intensity. Results were then analysed by a modification of ISR where the staining intensities obtained by each operator were substituted into the calculations. ?-Content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (�) were calculated at ??=?95% and 67% and the resulting accuracy profiles plotted. These revealed a systematic bias characterised by one operator favouring a score of 2 ++ over another favouring 3 +++. After the first validation experiment a programme of staff training was embarked upon. A gallery of 20 IHC images of CTC harvested by ISET from a number of different patients was constructed in order to facilitate a supervised training workshop. Here analysts were presented with 5 different sets of images where each set included an example of a patient CTC expressing AR at weak, moderate, strong and negative staining levels. One such set of 4 graded images taken from the gallery is illustrated in Figure  3. In the second validation experiment, the bias between operators observed in experiment 1 was completely eliminated (see Figure  4), and the value of ? for inter-operator agreement increased from 0.59 to 0.81 (Table  1), the latter being in the category of almost perfect agreement [22]. Figure 3 Typical example of the training set of images used to standardise AR receptor staining intensity in CTC isolated by ISET. After identifying significant operator bias in assigning staining intensities (see Figure 2), a standard gallery of 20 different images was produced as an aid to staff training. The figure contains a typical set of images from the gallery each containing a single patient derived CTC isolated on an ISET membrane and stained for AR expression by IHC to illustrate the different levels of staining intensity observed and the scoring system utilised in the present study. Figure 4 Further characterisation of inter-operator variability in AR staining intensity by IHC in CTC harvested from patient samples by ISET. After additional training utilising the standard gallery of images (see Figure 3), the same two analysts were invited to blindly score AR staining intensity in CTC harvested from patient blood samples by ISET. Again, results were analysed by a modification of ISR, ?-content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (�) were calculated at ??=?95% and 67% and the resulting accuracy profiles constructed. In this case, the bias observed in the first validation experiment (see Figure 2) appeared to be effectively eliminated. Since the samples proffered to the analysts in the second validation experiment were identical to those proffered in the first, this allowed for a conventional assessment of ISR [17] (see Figure  5). These data highlight the effect of the training programme, where analyst 1 showed a greater difference in scoring objects as 2++ between experiments , while analyst 2, as anticipated, showed a greater difference in scoring objects in the 3+++ category. It is also clear that the major effect of the training programme was more manifest on operator 2, while the degree of ISR achieved by operator 1 approached 30%. Figure 5 Incurred sample reanalysis in AR staining intensity determined by ?-content ?-confidence tolerance intervals. Due to the fact that the set of samples analysed blindly by two different operators in the first (Figure 2) and second (Figure 4) validation experiments were identical, this also allowed a conventional analysis of results by ISR utilising ?-content ?-confidence tolerance intervals (�) at ??=?95%. The resulting accuracy profiles clearly demonstrated that the training programme impacted almost exclusively on operator 2, correcting the between-operator bias in the process (Figure 2). They also highlight that the degree of ISR achievable in this analysis by operator 1 approached 30%, which is the accepted benchmark for total error for a typical quantitative biomarker assay. Discussion Fit-for-purpose biomarker method validation defines 5 categories of assay based on readout ranging from absolute quantitation to a nominal positive/negative result [13,14,24,25]. "
Prostate_Cancer "Along this spectrum, IHC in ocular microscopy mode is identified as an ordinal qualitative assay that yields categorical data presented as discrete scoring scales. Many of the performance characteristics normally associated with bioanalytical methods are not relevant to IHC, for example accuracy [26,27]. However, the main parameter of relevance to a qualitative assay is reproducibility: defined by the ICH as the �precision of repeated measurements between (operators and) laboratories� [14]. Or put more simply, �the property of receiving consistent results from following a specific procedure� [26]. Although there are many technical variables that could impact on the reproducibility of an IHC method, such as processing and embedding tissue and selection of section thickness, [27] the major source of error is recognised as that which is introduced by the reader [28,29]. In the present paper, method validation was performed on an IHC method for the determination of AR in CTC. While the focus was obviously reproducibility in addition to an assessment of specificity, the issue of inter-operator variability was addressed in a novel manner, through a modification of ISR [30,31]. Thus, in addition to conducting ISR in the conventional format (where typically a single operator analyses the same set of samples twice), in our modification two different operators each analysed the same set of samples once and the results were then subjected to statistical analysis by BCTI. We have previously demonstrated that in the case of CTC enumeration by CellSearch this modified approach to ISR was exquisitely sensitive in differentiating between both systematic (bias) and random (imprecision) errors [15]. Our results confirm that even in the relatively less complex scenario of a single CTC sitting on a filter, there is still considerable between-operator variability in the assignment of a scoring intensity. However, since BCTI identifies the nature of the inter-operator error, it also allowed for its correction through additional staff training. In addition, by adoption of this approach it has been demonstrated that a highly trained analyst is capable of achieving scores in the repeat analysis of samples that varied by 30%, which is within the accepted benchmark for total error of a typical quantitative biomarker/pharmacodynamic assay such as an ELISA [14,25,32]. As a categorical assay, IHC has a dynamic range restricted to a limited number (normally 3 to 4) of band widths of staining intensity. Nonetheless, in preclinical studies with AZD3514, and utilising the same scoring structure as the present method (0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+), IHC was able to demonstrate a dose dependent reduction on AR in tumour tissue, at doses of drug that produced only a modest inhibition of tumour growth [6]. In the same report a comparative evaluation was conducted between ocular microscopy and image analysis using the Aperio system (ePathology Solutions, Oxford, UK). Reassuringly, both approaches reported a similar level of knockdown in AR. Among current IHC techniques approved by the FDA as diagnostic, prognostic or predicative biomarkers, no claims are made that image analysis is any more accurate than visual assessment by a trained pathologist [27]. The ISET technique is an example of a tumour-marker-independent technology based on filtration through 8 ?m pores, unlike the FDA cleared CellSearch System which relies critically on the presence of epithelial markers (EpCam) and antibody directed capture [21,33]. However, the ISET technique may have an advantage over CellSearch since it is now believed that a significant proportion of malignant CTCs lose their �epithelial markers� in preference to mesenchymal antigens, in a process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition [34-36]. As a consequence the ISET technique invariably harvests larger populations of CTC from patient blood than the CellSearch system [37]. Nonetheless, while the ISET technique is claimed to effectively remove the majority of hematologic cells - red blood cells by lysis and peripheral blood leukocytes by filtration [12] - rare hematologic cells (megakaryocytes or large monocytes) or mesenchymal (endothelial) cells may be difficult to distinguish from epithelial tumour cells by cytopathologic or immunochemical analysis [38]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated in a number of different disease types, that ISET harvests cells of a non-malignant morphology from a small but significant group of subjects that could potentially result in a false-positive diagnosis [38]. These results advise caution when relying on a single technique to isolate CTC from patients. Conclusions A novel procedure is presented for the fit-for-purpose evaluation of the reproducibility of an IHC method for the determination of AR receptor expression levels in CTC isolated from patients as a biomarker assay utilising a modification of ISR and BCTI for statistical analysis of results. The procedure was employed to identify and correct inter-operator bias in the assignment of a scoring intensity and poor reproducibility, resulting potentially in a reduction of measurement error to a level normally associated with a quantitative biomarker assay, such as an ELISA. The methodological approach could be applied theoretically to any generic IHC method.

Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading male oncologic malignancy wideworld. During malignant transformation, normal epithelial cells undergo genetic and morphological changes known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several regulatory genes and specific marker proteins are involved in PC EMT. Recently, syndecans have been associated with malignancy grade and Gleason score in PC. Considering that SNAIL is mainly a gene repressor increased in PC and that syndecan promoters have putative binding sites for this repressor, we propose that SNAIL might regulate syndecan expression during PC EMT. The aim of this study was to analyze immunochemically the expression of SNAIL, syndecans 1 and 2 and other EMT markers in a tissue microarray (TMA) of PC samples and PC cell lines. The TMAs included PC samples of different Gleason grade and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, as non-malignant controls. PC3 and LNCaP cell lines were used as models of PC representing different tumorigenic capacities. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed on TMAs and fluorescence immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis were conducted on cell cultures. Results show that SNAIL exhibits increased expression in high Gleason specimens compared to low histological grade and BPH samples. Accordingly, PC3 cells show higher SNAIL expression levels compared to LNCaP cells. Conversely, syndecan 1, similarly to E-cadherin (a known marker of EMT), shows a decreased expression in high Gleason grades samples and PC3 cells. Interestingly, syndecan 2 shows no changes associated to histological grade. It is concluded that increased SNAIL levels in advanced PC are associated with low expression of syndecan 1. The mechanism by which SNAIL regulates the expression of syndecan 1 remains to be investigated. prostate cancer SNAIL syndecans epithelial-mesenchymal transition Introduction Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. According to epidemiological data, the estimated new cases will be over 900,000 and estimated deaths over 250,000 each year (1). PC originates from glandular epithelial cells mainly from the peripheral zone of the gland (2�4). During PC progression, normal tissue architecture is lost and malignant cells acquire invasive characteristics (5,6). In addition, PC is multifocal exhibiting different histopathological patterns graded from 1 to 5 (Gleason grades). Diagnosis is accompanied by Gleason score that considers the two predominant patterns, giving a final value ranging from 2�10, where high Gleason scores correspond to more undifferentiated tumors (7). This transformation involves alterations in cell morphology and function, called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (8). During EMT many molecules change their expression pattern. Transcription factors such as SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST, and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin, increase their expression. Some adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin decrease their expression and others such as ?-catenin change their location from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (9). It has been shown that the decrease in E-cadherin is associated with poor prognosis in various human tumors (10�13). In addition, E-cadherin overexpression in cultured cells and in vivo tumor models leads to a decrease of invasiveness and metastasis (14). Immunohistochemical studies on PC tissue microarray showed that SNAIL staining is associated with Gleason grade (15) with increasing expression from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to PC bone metastasis (16). SNAIL transcription factor is a zinc finger protein that can mediate EMT through downregulation of cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin by binding to E-boxes located in the gene promoter region. SNAIL can also lead to repression of tight junction proteins like claudin, occluidin and zona occluden-1 (ZO-1) (16). Recently, syndecans, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan family, have been shown to be involved in the PC progression (17). In particular, syndecans 1 and 2 expression has been associated with the malignancy grade rated by the Gleason score (18�21). Transcriptional regulation of syndecans is poorly understood. A complete characterization of syndecan 1 and 2 promoters has been reported (22). In this regard, Vihinen et al (1996) were able to map a highly active syndecan 1 promoter region with binding capacity for Sp1 (22). No enhancer sites were found in either the upstream region or the first intron (up to +15 kb), while some repressor elements upstream of the promoter (?2.4 to ?4 to 4 kb) were identified. In addition, 5 E-box sequences were found in syndecan promoter to which SNAIL might bind, repressing this syndecan in a direct way (23). Previous in silico analysis performed in our laboratory (unpublished data) revealed the presence of several putative binding sites for SNAIL-1 in the promoter regions of syndecans 1 and 2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of SNAIL and its association with syndecans 1 and 2, and other EMT markers in PC samples and cell lines. We propose that syndecans may be regulated by SNAIL decreasing their expression during EMT in PC. Materials and methods Biopsy samples PC specimens were obtained from the biopsy archive of the Pathological Anatomy Service, Clinic Hospital University of Chile, with the corresponding authorization of the institutional Ethics Committee. All samples were evaluated by an expert pathologist (I.G.). For the immunohistochemical evaluation specimens were grouped as BPH samples, a non-malignant control, and PC samples with high and low histological Gleason grade. Cell lines and culture conditions Human PC cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained under standard culture conditions at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. Antibodies Primary antibodies were obtained from Abcam (SNAIL, N-cadherin; Cambridge, MA, USA), BD Transduction (E-cadherin; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (syndecan-1, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Contreras et al (24) (syndecan-2). Anti-rabbit secondary fluorescein-conjugated antibody, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). Tissue microarray (TMA) construction The PC TMA was constructed as follows: first, the most representative tumor areas were carefully selected and marked based on the matched hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides. Altogether, 104 cores (1.5 mm diameter) of test tissue were taken from the donor blocks with a tissue microarrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Sections were stained with H&E and then evaluated by the pathologist. The TMA contained a mixture of tissue so that both benign and malignant samples of different Gleason grades were represented on each block. Sections of 4 ?m were obtained with a microtome and transferred to glass slides (SuperFrosts Plus, Menzel-Gl�ser, Braunschweig, Germany). Finally, colon (3) and tonsil (3) samples were included as positive control for syndecans. Immunohistochemistry Tumor and control formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples (TMA) were cut into 4-?m sections, mounted, deparaffinized and rehydrated in decreasing concentration of ethanol and distilled water. The sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and antigen retrieval was performed in a steam bath for 15 min at 90�95�C in 10 mM Citrate Buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxydase activity was inhibited by incubation in 3% H2O2. Later on, the sections were washed and non-specific binding was blocked with 10% normal horse serum solution (Vectastain). Then, sections were incubated with corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4�C or 1 h at 37�C. Afterwards, samples were incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min at 37�C. Then, samples were washed and incubated with the streptavidin-biotin system (Histostain�-Plus Bulk Kit). After washing, the sections were incubated for 2 min at room temperature with liquid 3,3�-diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB) (Zymed�, LAB-SA Detection System and DAB-Plus Substrate Kit) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Finally, samples were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, coverslipped and evaluated in a microscope Leica DM 2500 (18,21). Immunocytochemistry Cells were grown on 6-well tissue culture plates over sterilized glass coverslips until 50�70% confluence was reached. Then, cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and sucrose in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and stored in 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide in PBS at 4�C. Before incubation with the antibodies, the coverslips were washed with a 20 mM PBS-glycine solution and then blocked with PBS-glycine (20 mM)-BSA (0.1%). The cells were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4�C or 1 h at 37�C, rinsed with 20 mM PBS-glycine solution three times and incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Fluorescein-Conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit) away from light for 2 h. Finally, the coverslips were mounted and visualized under a spinning disc microscope (Olympus BX61Wl). Staining quantification Photographs from immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were digitally processed to obtain the integrated optical density (IOD). The average gray value of each image was used to obtain the IOD. The IOD corresponds to absorption of an optical element per unit distance for a given wavelength. The staining and illumination conditions of the samples were equivalent. Western blot analysis The cell culture medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,050 � g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 nM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 nM EDTA), with a protease inhibitor cocktail (0.01 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.002 mg/ml antipain, 0.005 mg/ml leupeptin, 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM Na3VO4, pH 7.4). Later, the cells were scraped and the lysate was collected in a microfuge tube and passed through a syringe to break up the cell aggregates. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 � g for 15 min at 4�C, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was collected for protein quantification by the Bradford method at 570 nM using a Ray Leigh spectrophotometer (UV-1600 model). For western blot analysis, 40 ?g of protein were resolved over 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A molecular weight standard (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was also resolved for analyzing specific zones of the gels. The efficiency of the process was measured staining the membranes with Ponceau Red reactive. The non-specific sites on membranes were blocked with blocking buffer [TBS-Tween-20 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) - 5% non-fat dry milk] for 1 h at room temperature. Then, membranes were incubated with the corresponding primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4�C, followed by incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody peroxidase conjugated (in blocking buffer) and detected by chemiluminescence (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) and autoradiography. The western blot analysis bands were scanned and analyzed using the scientific software program UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Corporation, Orem, UT, USA). Statistics analysis Data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS v17.0 software. Normal distribution was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Given the distribution of the data, a parametric test (Pearson test) to calculate the correlation index was used. ANOVA (Tukey�s test) was used to compare means. P<0.01 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results TMA analysis From the 98 samples of PC in the TMA (excluding colon and tonsil controls), 4 spots containing prostatic stromal tissue were ruled out. Samples used for analysis were classified into 4 groups: non-tumoral control (BPH), and low, medium and high Gleason grade PC samples. The histological characteristics of the TMA groups stained with H&E are presented in Fig. 1. TMA included 45 BPH and 47 PC spots [9 corresponding to low (grade 1�2), 23 medium (grade 3) and 15 high Gleason grade (grade 4�5)], giving a total of 98 samples. SNAIL expression and distribution in prostate samples SNAIL staining is observed mainly in nuclei and shows increased intensity in high Gleason compared to low grade samples (Fig. 2A). H&E dyeing was omitted to avoid interfering with SNAIL nuclear specific staining. Average IOD for each sample showed normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov P=0.689). Subsequently, the IOD means were compared by ANOVA. Samples with a high Gleason grades show SNAIL-staining IOD means significantly higher (P<0.01) than samples with low Gleason grade and BPH (P<0.0001) (Fig. 2B). Given the normal distribution, the Pearson test established a correlation coefficient of 0.734 between the IOD and the Gleason grade. Syndecan 1 expression and distribution in prostate samples The expression and distribution of syndecan 1 show a very heterogeneous pattern within the groups studied. BPH spots show a strong intensity localized mainly in the cytoplasm and membrane of the basal cells. Furthermore, epithelial cells exhibit a preferential localization in the baso-lateral region and approximately 50% of the cytoplasmic localization is detected at variable intensity (weak to moderate). This syndecan 1 distribution is also found in the low Gleason group and, to a lesser extent, in the medium Gleason group. However, in PC spots with high Gleason grade, membrane localization is lost and a granular cytoplasmic localization with low intensity is observed (Fig. 3)."
Prostate_Cancer "The main difference of this marker among the groups is found in its location. For comparison, E-cadherin (a validated epithelial marker) expression and distribution was evaluated in PC TMA samples. This epithelial marker shows an expected membrane location in most samples with intensities varying from moderate to strong. In BPH spots, E-cadherin shows mainly baso-lateral location in gland epithelial cells and was absent in apical membrane. On the other hand, low Gleason grade samples show syndecan 1 intensity and distribution similar to BPH. However, in high Gleason grade spots, a loss of intensity associated to gland architecture disorganization is observed (Fig. 3E). In addition, E-cadherin distribution shows a mixed pattern including cytoplasm location (Fig. 3F). Significant decrease in E-cadherin expression is observed only in medium and high Gleason grade samples (Fig. 3F). Syndecan 2 expression and distribution in prostate samples The expression of this marker is highly variable in terms of location and immunostaining intensity. Similar to syndecan 1, syndecan 2 is found in both baso-lateral membrane and granular cytoplasm. BPH specimens show a high intensity in basal cells and basal lamina (Fig. 4A�D). No significant difference in syndecan 2 expression is observed among the different Gleason grade spots (Fig. 4E). However, cell location changes as Gleason grade increases, switching from membrane-cytoplasmic to cytoplasm-nucleus localization. Syndecan 2 is highly expressed in fibroblast, therefore, its presence in stroma served as internal positive control. For comparison, N-cadherin (a validated stromal marker) expression and distribution was evaluated in PC TMA samples. N-cadherin expression in BPH showed a mixed pattern including both membrane and cytoplasm location in epithelial cells. However, the immunostaining intensity, unlike E-cadherin, is weak (Fig. 4Fa�d). The intensity of N-cadherin staining is strong in stroma due to this molecule being highly expressed in fibroblast and mesenchymal tissue. For this reason, it serves also as an internal positive control (Fig. 4A). As expected, this marker is increasing with the disorganization of prostate gland epithelium. In low Gleason samples, N-cadherin is expressed mainly in baso-lateral membrane of epithelial cells while in medium grade spots the immunostaining of this molecule shows a decrease in membrane and an increase in cytoplasm. Furthermore, in high Gleason samples, N-cadherin shows a high expression of the membrane, cytoplasmatic and even nuclear location. N-cadherin expression is different only between BPH and medium/high Gleason grade samples (Fig. 4Fe). SNAIL expression in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines Considering that LNCaP and PC3 cell lines have been widely used as in vitro model for PC, we studied the location of the transcription factor SNAIL in these commercial cell lines using fluorescent immunocytochemistry. Different cellular SNAIL distribution is observed in these cell lines. LNCaP cells (low tumorigenic capacity) show a homogeneous localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). However, PC3 cells (high tumorigenic capacity) show an exclusively nuclear localization (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the SNAIL staining intensity is very high and occasionally detected at the perinuclear region. Localization is more evident when performing a merge between SNAIL staining (green) and actin microfilaments (red). When comparing IOD, significant differences in the SNAIL expression between the cell lines were found (Fig. 5C). In addition, protein extraction and western blot analysis were performed to compare the SNAIL expression between the cell lines. Results show a higher SNAIL protein expression in PC3 than LNCaP cells (Fig. 5D and E). Syndecans 1 and 2 expression in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines Results obtained from syndecans 1 and 2 expression are presented in Fig. 6. In LNCaP and PC3 cells, expression of both syndecans is evident at plasma membrane (Fig. 6B, C, E and F). Comparison of IOD, in LNCaP cells (low tumorigenic capacity) show a higher syndecans expression than PC3 cells (high tumorigenic capacity) (Fig. 6G and H). E-cadherin (control epithelial marker) shows a similar pattern (Fig. 6A and D) and IOD (Fig. 6I). Discussion Searching for markers with diagnostic and prognostic utility is a major challenge in cancer field. In this regard, several markers of EMT such as SNAIL and TWIST, have recently been associated with clinical variables in localized PC. In this analysis, TWIST and vimentin, stand out as good predictors of biochemical recurrence (25). Recently, some roles for proteoglycans in PC have been reported. Cellular changes and enzymatic activity in the developing tumor can alter the composition and structure of proteoglycans modifying their function (17). Our group has reported that some heparan sulfate proteoglycans (syndecans 1 and 2) have a close association with malignancy and may also be useful as markers of biochemical recurrence of PC (18,21). Regarding syndecan 1, other studies have pointed out its utility as a marker of malignancy with prognostic utility. In these studies syndecan 1 is expressed in inverse relation to Gleason score (26,27). The prognostic value of this syndecan in patients treated with radical prostatectomy has been also established (28). However, other authors reported, despite the reduction of syndecan 1 in high Gleason samples, that this syndecan is not a good predictor for tumor recurrence or survival, reducing its clinical importance as a marker (29). Regarding syndecan 2, changes from membrane to cytoplasm localization are associated with increasing Gleason score. The syndecan 2 distribution is observed mainly at the cytoplasm and nucleus in high Gleason grades. Nuclear presence of this syndecan suggests its involvement in transcriptional processes. Our results are consistent with recent reports detecting nuclear localization of syndecans (30). In addition, the proteolytic cleavage of syndecan results in extracellular releasing of its ectodomain. Multiple roles have been described for syndecan shedding in health and disease (31,32). The ectodomain may promote tumor growth and angiogenesis (33) and cytosolic domain might be translocated to the nucleus regulating gene expression (30). Recently, Smith and Odero-Marah (16) have reported the possible role of SNAIL in PC and its potential utility as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, it has been reported that the SNAIL1 increased expression was positively correlated with PC de-differentiation, but not with cancer progression or prognosis. There is evidence indicating that SNAIL expression is upregulated from the early stages of PC (15). The association between increased expression of SNAIL and prostate malignancy found in the present study is in agreement with other previous works (8,34). Evidence provided by this work support the hypothesis that SNAIL could be repressing the expression of syndecan 1, in the same way as E-cadherin (35,36). The decreased expression of syndecan 1 is associated with the loss of basal cells and normal epithelial organization. Considering that there are putative binding sites for SNAIL in both syndecans promoters, it is reasonable to suggest an active role for SNAIL in PC malignancy regulation. In our study, SNAIL was detected preferentially localized in the nuclear region showing a gradually increasing intensity with the Gleason grade. In addition, the high SNAIL expression in PC3 cells (high tumorigenic capacity) compared with LNCaP cells (low tumorigenic capacity), strongly suggest that SNAIL could be favoring the tumorigenic process through different cellular mechanisms. In PC cell lines, the expression of SNAIL, using specific siRNA, has been shown to play a role by inhibiting cellular aging (37). As a result, such cells decreased their survival, presenting an increase in caspase activity. Baritaki et al (38) studied the effects of a proteasome inhibitor (NPI-0052) on metastatic PC cell lines showing that treated cells decreased SNAIL levels and increased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, these cells were unable to initiate EMT"

Abstract Background The radiation resistance of prostate cancer remains the primary obstacle to improve patient survival. This study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine, a commonly used natural product, on the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer. Methods Prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and DU-145 were subjected to hypoxia and/or ionizing radiation (IR), in the presence or absence of berberine treatment. Cell growth and colony formation, and apoptosis were evaluated. Moreover, LNCaP cells were xenografted into nude mice and subjected to IR and/or berberine treatment. The expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in prostate cancer cells and xenografts was detected by Western blot analysis. Results Berberine increased radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells and xenografts in a dose dependent manner, and this was correlated with the inhibition of HIF-1? and VEGF expression. Conclusions Berberine may inhibit the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF and thus confer radiosensitivity on prostatic cancer cells. Berberine has potential application as an adjuvant in radiotherapy of prostatic cancer.

Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of death from cancer. Asian prostate cancer patients had better survival but the incidence rate of PCa has been increasing rapidly in recent years [1]. Currently, radiation therapy is the main treatment for PCa and provides excellent local control and increased overall survival for PCa patients [2]. However, some PCa patients exhibit radiation resistance and develop metastatic disease in less than 5 years [3]. Thus it is an important issue to reduce radiation resistance and increase radiosensitivity of PCa. Hypoxia is a common feature of malignant tumors and makes solid tumors resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) [4]. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is one of the main regulators of cell response to hypoxia. HIF-1? is a subunit of HIF-1 and regulates the expression of a variety of downstream target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and could confer resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy [5,6]. Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of isoquinoline alkaloids. A number of studies have shown that berberine has anti-tumor activity for a variety of cancers. However, the effects of berberine on PCa have not been reported. In this study, we showed that berberine could inhibit HIF-1? expression in hypoxic PCa cells and thus sensitize the cells to IR. Moreover, we found that berberine could sensitize nude mice bearing PCa cells to IR by inhibiting the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF. Methods Cell culture and treatment Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU-145 were purchased from Shanghai Cell Bank, and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37�C in 5% CO2 and 21% O2 or 0.8% O2 in a humidified atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA every 2�3 days. The cells were irradiated in ambient air with 6 MV X-rays at a dose rate of 5.66 Gy/min at room temperature. Berberine hydrochloride (>95%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MTT assay Cells in early log phase were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates at a density of 4,000 cells/well. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with different concentrations of berberine (20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400 ?M). Cell viability was detected on day 1, 2 and 3 by MTT assay following the manufacturer�s instructions. Briefly, 10 ?l of MTT was added into each well to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After incubation for 4 h, the cell supernatants were removed and DMSO (150 ?l) was added to dissolve MTT crystals (formazan). The absorbance of the samples at 490 nm was read using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 630; Hercules, CA, USA). Clonogenic assay Cells in early log phase were trypsinized and plated in 6-well plates. Then the cells were treated with or without bererine for the indicated time and then subjected to X-rays of 2, 4, 6, 8 Gy at room temperature. The cells were incubated at 37�C for 12 days for LNCaP cells and 14 days for DU-145 cells, fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. Finally, the plates were inspected by microscopy and the number of the colonies with at least 50 cells was counted. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis Cells in early log phase were trypsinized and plated in 6-well plates at a specific density. The cells were treated with or without bererine in normxia or hypoxia for 24 h, then exposed to X-rays (6 Gy). After 3 h, the cells were collected and incubated with Annexin V and propidium iodide for 15 min. The apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry using light scatter characteristics (BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK). Western blot analysis Total cell lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in protein extraction buffer, and protein concentration was analyzed using the BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell Bio-Science). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with HIF-1? antibody (1:200), VEGF antibody (1:250) and ?-actin antibody (1:250) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, CA, USA) overnight at 4�C. The membranes were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature, and the signals were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Immunofuorescence Cells in early log phase were trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates at a density of 4,000 cells/well. The cells were exposed to bererine and/or hypoxia for 24 h. Cells were fixed with methanol at ?20�C for 20 min, and washed 3 times with PBS. Next the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse HIF-1? antibody (1:250) or goat anti-rabbit VEGF antibody (1:250) for 16 h at 4�C, then incubated with anti-mouse-FITC or anti-rabbit-FITC (Jackson, USA) at a dilution of 1:150 for 1.5 h in the dark at room temperature. Finally, cells were mounted onto glass slides and observed under Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Tumor xenograft mouse models Animal experiments were approved by Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University. Male BALB/C nude mice (4�5 weeks old) were provided by Nanjing Medical University Animal Center. Mice were then subcutaneously inoculated with LNCaP cells (5?�?106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS) at one site of the right armpit. When the average volume of tumour (visualized as small nodules at the sites of injection) increased to 150 mm3, the animals were randomly grouped into 6 different groups (n?=?6): (1) vehicle (PBS), (2) 5 mg/kg berberine, (3) 10 mg/kg berberine, (4) 8 Gy IR, (5) 5 mg/kg berberine plus 8 Gy IR, (6) 10 mg/kg berberine plus 8 Gy IR. The mice in control group were treated with vehicle control, whereas the mice in 2, 3, 5 and 6 groups were given daily intraperitoneal injection of 5 or 10 mg/kg berberine every two days for 6 times. Tumors were irradiated by RS-2000 biological irradiator at a dose of 8 Gy with X-rays (2 Gy/min) delivered 2 h after injection on day 12. Tumor growth was measured every two days, the tumor volume was calculated according to the formula: Tumor volume?=?[length (L)?�?width (W)]2/2. The percentage of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated as follows: TGI (%)?=?[1-(mean change in the tumor volume in each group/mean change in the tumor volume in the control group)]?�?100. The tumor doubling time (DT) was calculated as follows: DT?=?d?�?lg2/lg(Vd/V0), where d was the length of time between two measurements, Vd was the volume of the tumor treated with X-ray and V0 was the volume of the tumor before the X-ray. Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean?�?Standard Deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments, and analyzed by SPSS statistical software system for Windows version 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA). Statistical significance was determined by using Student�s t-test and p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results Berberine sensitizes prostatic cancer cells to IR in normoxia and hypoxia conditions The viability of PCa cell lines LNCaP and DU-145 cells was detected after treatment with different concentrations of berberine for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. MTT assay showed that berberine reduced the cell viability in a concentration and time dependent manner (Figure 1A). At 24 h, the IC50 of berberine for LNCaP and DU-145 cells were 220.36 ?? and 163.56 ??, respectively."
Prostate_Cancer "Thus we chose the concentrations of berberine at 30 and 50 ?M for subsequent experiments.Clonogenic assay showed the radiation dose�response survival curves for LNCaP and DU-145 cells with or without berberine treatment for 24 h in normoxia and hypoxia conditions (Figure 1B). Both normoxic and hypoxic PCa cells that were pretreated with berberine exhibited a significantly increased sensitivity to IR, as reflected by the remarkable decrease in their ability to form colonies.The induction of apoptotic cell death is an important mechanism by which radio-/chemotherapy kills tumor cells. Next we detected apoptosis in LNCaP and DU-145 cells treated by berberine or/and IR (6 Gy). The rate of apoptotic cell death was higher in cells pretreated with 50 ?M berberine than in cells pretreated with 30 ?M berberine. Furthermore, berberine (30 ?? and 50 ??) combined with IR, the rate of apoptotic cell death was significant higher in cells treated with both berberine and IR than in cells treated with IR alone (Figure 1C,D). Figure 1 Berberine sensitizes LNCaP and DU-145 cells to IR. (A) berberine inhibited the growth of LNCaP and DU-145 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

Berberine inhibits HIF-1? and VEGF expression in prostatic cancer cells To investigate whether HIF-1? and VEGF are involved in berberine mediated radiosensitivity of prostatic cancer cells, we performed Western blot and immunofuorescence analysis to detect the protein expression of HIF-1? and VEGF. The results showed that hypoxia induced the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in LNCaP and DU-145 cells (Figure 2A). Similarly, IR induced the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in LNCaP and DU-145 cells (Figure 2B). However, the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF was decreased in hypoxic LNCaP and DU-145 cells treated with berberine compared to cells treated with hypoxia alone (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF was decreased in LNCaP and DU-145 cells treated with the combination of berberine and IR compared to cells treated with IR alone (Figure 2D). Moreover, the effects of berberine on HIF-1? and VEGF expression were concentration dependent (Figure 2C and Figure 2D).Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that HIF-1? was only located in the nucleus of normoxic cells, but VEGF was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 3). The translocation of HIF-1? and VEGF into the nucleus was observed in hypoxic LNCaP and DU-145 cells, which was inhibited prominently by berberine. And high concentration of berberine (50 ?M) exhibited stronger inhibitory effects than the low concentration (30 ?M). Taken together, these results suggest that berberine inhibits the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in LNCaP and DU-145 cells.

Representative images of laser scanning confocal microscopy showed nuclear colocalization of HIF-1? and VEGF (green stain) in cells with hypoxia with or without berberine treatment (30 ?M and 50 ?M). Ber: berberine, 30: 30 ?M, 50: 50 ?M. Berberine sensitizes prostatic cancer to IR in vivo We next evaluated the effects of berberine on the radiosensitivity of PCa in vivo.Tumors were induced by s.c. injection of LNCaP cells into nude mice. We measured the body weight of the nude mice every week and the tumor volume every four days. The results showed that none of the treatment regimens produced any loss of body weight, which may be a sign of toxicity (Figure 4A). Combined treatment with IR and berberine significantly suppressed tumor volume and tumor weight in nude mice, compared to IR or berberine treatment alone (Figure 4B-D). As shown in Table 1, tumor growth delay (TGD) time for the 28-day treatment of Ber (5 or 10 mg/kg) alone was 12.3 or 13.1 days, not significantly different from that of control group (p?=?0.3453, p?=?0.2526, respectively). IR alone produced a TGD time of 5.7 days (p?=?0.0116 compared to control group). The combined treatment with IR and berberine (5 or 10 mg/kg) resulted in a TGD time of 21.4 or 22.7 days, respectively (p?<?0.05, compared with IR alone or berberine alone). Moreover, the combined treatment of IR and berberine (5 or 10 mg/kg) resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 66.6% and 75.9% on Day 40, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that berberine sensitizes PCa to IR in vivo. Figure 4 Berberine increases radiosensitivity of LNCaP xenografts.

Berberine inhibits HIF-1? and VEGF expression in xenografts induced by IR Finally, we examined the effects of berberine on the expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in xenografts. Western blot analysis showed that berberine decreased IR-induced expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in LNCaP xenografts in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4E). Discussion It is crucially to predict pathological outcomes prior to surgery for appropriate surgical indication of PCa patients who receive radical prostatectomy [7]. Several biomarkers have been implicated in the initiation and progression of PCa [8,9]. Currently, the radiation resistance of prostate cancer remains the primary obstacle to improve patient survival. Several studies have investigated the mechanism underlying the radiosensitivity for the treatment of PCa. The inactivation of clusterin by anti-sense technology improved the outcomes of radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients [10]. Furthermore, a recent study showed that arsenic trioxide enhanced the radiation sensitivity of PCa through the inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling pathways [11]. Importantly, HIF-1? is commonly upregulated in hypoxic tumour tissues, which may render resistance to radiotherapy [12]. Some anti-cancer drugs increase cancer cells radiosensitivity by downregulating HIF-1? [13]. It is well known that natural compounds confer radiosensitivity on cancer cells, such as curcumin and berberine [14-16]. However, there has been no report on the effects of berberine on the radiosensitivity of PCa. In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time that berberine could efficiently downregulate HIF-1? expression in hypoxic prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Berberine treatment also inhibited the upregulation of HIF-1? induced by IR in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the downregulation of HIF-1?, we observed that berberine decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in hypoxic LNCaP and DU-145 cells. "
Prostate_Cancer "The androgen receptor (AR)-binding transcription factor (TF) RUNX2 has been linked to prostate cancer (PCa) progression but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully defined. In this study, we investigated the genome-wide influence of RUNX2 on androgen-induced gene expression and AR DNA binding in PCa cells. RUNX2 inhibited the androgen response partly by promoting the dissociation of AR from its target genes such as the tumor suppressor NKX3-1. However, AR activity persists in the presence of RUNX2 at other AR target genes, some of which are co-operatively stimulated by androgen and RUNX2 signaling. These genes are associated with putative enhancers co-occupied by AR and RUNX2. One such gene, the invasion-promoting Snail family TF SNAI2, was co-activated by AR and RUNX2. Indeed, these two TFs together, but neither alone stimulated PCa cell invasiveness, which could be abolished by SNAI2 silencing. In support of our results, an immunohistochemical analysis of SNAI2 in archived primary PCa specimens revealed a correlation with the RUNX2 histoscore; and, simultaneous strong staining for SNAI2, RUNX2 and AR (but not any pair alone) was associated with disease recurrence. Overall, our findings suggest that AR and RUNX2 cooperate to stimulate certain invasion-promoting genes like SNAI2, which might be targeted for individualized PCa therapy. combinatorial transcriptional control mRNA profiling ChIP-seq metastasis invasion recurrence PLoS One PLoS ONE plos plosone PLoS ONE 1932-6203 Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 24699716 3974761 PONE-D-13-46831 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600 Research Article Computer and Information Sciences Computer Applications Computer-Aided Design Computing Methods Computer Inferencing Mathematical Computing Medicine and Health Sciences Diagnostic Medicine Diagnostic Radiology Magnetic Resonance Imaging Oncology Cancers and Neoplasms Genitourinary Tract Tumors Prostate Cancer Basic Cancer Research Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Radiology and Imaging Urology Prostate Diseases Incremental Learning with SVM for Multimodal Classification of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Incremental Learning for Recognition of Cancer Garc�a Molina Jos� Fernando 1 * Zheng Lei 1 Sertdemir Metin 2 Dinter Dietmar J. 2 Sch�nberg Stefan 2 R�dle Matthias 3 1 Institute of Experimental Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany 2 Institute for Clinical Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany 3 Institute of Process Control and Innovative Energy Conversion (PI), Hochschule Mannheim, University of Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany Gupta Dinesh Editor International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), India * E-mail: fernandogarcia.jm@gmail.com Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.

Robust detection of prostatic cancer is a challenge due to the multitude of variants and their representation in MR images. We propose a pattern recognition system with an incremental learning ensemble algorithm using support vector machines (SVM) tackling this problem employing multimodal MR images and a texture-based information strategy. The proposed system integrates anatomic, texture, and functional features. The data set was preprocessed using B-Spline interpolation, bias field correction and intensity standardization. First- and second-order angular independent statistical approaches and rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) were utilized to quantify texture information. An incremental learning ensemble SVM was implemented to suit working conditions in medical applications and to improve effectiveness and robustness of the system. The probability estimation of cancer structures was calculated using SVM and the corresponding optimization was carried out with a heuristic method together with a 3-fold cross-validation methodology. We achieved an average sensitivity of 0.844�0.068 and a specificity of 0.780�0.038, which yielded superior or similar performance to current state of the art using a total database of only 41 slices from twelve patients with histological confirmed information, including cancerous, unhealthy non-cancerous and healthy prostate tissue. Our results show the feasibility of an ensemble SVM being able to learn additional information from new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge and preventing unlearning. The use of texture descriptors provides more salient discriminative patterns than the functional information used. Furthermore, the system improves selection of information, efficiency and robustness of the classification. The generated probability map enables radiologists to have a lower variability in diagnosis, decrease false negative rates and reduce the time to recognize and delineate structures in the prostate.

Introduction The most frequently diagnosed cancer for men in Germany, the UK and the US is prostatic adenocarcinoma [1]�[3]. New imaging techniques in MRI and their integration [4] have been developed with the aim of providing more information to radiologists, to improve visual interpretation and to formulate a better staging of prostate cancer. However, radiologists who perform clinical routines have to face a variety of MRI modalities, analyze a considerable amount of data and provide their evaluation. This routine requires substantial human interaction, and due to the challenging nature of interpreting and staging prostate cancer, data may be filtered cognitively or disregarded. Variations and inconsistencies in reports exist. MR imaging of the prostate has become so advanced that it presents a �dizzying array of data� for interpretation [5]. Various MR imaging modalities have been studied to improve visual inspection and diagnosis of cancer. MRI Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI), MRI Dynamic-Contrast Enhanced (DCE) and MR-Spectroscopy [6]�[11] have been investigated. The general consensus is that combination of modalities increases the prediction accuracy of the diagnosis. However, the inter- and intra-variability in diagnosis and the significant amount of information to analyze have motivated the development of automated tools aimed at achieving a higher cancer detection rate and reducing clinical processing time simultaneously. To reduce variability and inconsistency, automatic approaches for detection of prostate cancer using 1.5T multimodal imaging have been developed for in vivo studies on a per-voxel basis. The utility of multimodal imaging from coronal plane with 3D features (e.g. 3D co-occurrence matrix and a discrete cosine transform) and fisher linear discriminant (FLD) has been demonstrated using computer vision techniques [12]. The performance and robustness of second-order and first-order statistical discriminants alongside feature ensemble and random forest methods have also been enhanced [13], [14]. Statistical features and MR Spectroscopy have been used together with a multikernel graph embedding method demonstrating the contribution of multimodality classification [15]. The implemented second-order statistical approaches in these studies are based however on angular dependent features. Haralick [16] suggested a method invariant under rotation but the disadvantage is the computational cost involved, both in terms of memory requirement and computational time [17], [18]. We implemented an angular independent approach based on [17], integrating features with texture proprieties close to the human perception mechanism, which was also used by other medical applications [19]. We integrate features by considering the relationship between an element and all its neighboring elements at one time instead of one direction at a time, an approach based on [18]. In Madabhushi [13] a Gabor operator was employed to extract frequency signatures. However, the contribution of this method negatively affect the classification results. Other methods as local phase quantization (LPQ) [20] and local binary pattern (LBP) [21] have been utilized to quantify textural properties. Ojansivu [22] introduced a rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) to extract texture information. RI-LPQ outperformed Gabor operator as well as local binary patterns (LBP). Thus, RI-LPQ was implemented to identify frequency signatures. Detection feasibility of cancer using support vector machines (SVM) and MR images (T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DWI and wash-in-rate () derived from DCE) has been demonstrated [23]�[25]. Moreover, the performance of SVM was enhanced in comparison with other classification methods for the recognition of prostate cancer using different MRI modalities (T2-weighted, DWI-ADC and pharmacokinetic parameters derived from DCE) [26], [27]. SVM performs well when the data set is limited in size and nonlinearly distributed. However, as is the case for any supervised classifier, performance and precision rely on the availability of a considerable data set size of correctly identified observations. Generally, the studies using SVM to learn from new data involves discarding the existing classifier, aggregating the new data to the old set and training a new classifier from scratch. As an effect, these methods result in unlearning [28], which is the inability of the system to learn new patterns without forgetting previously learned ones. Not forgetting old or underrepresented patterns is important for the recognition of prostate cancer because of the different possible features of cancer and its overlap with non-cancerous or normal structures. Such unlearning can be addressed through an incremental learning algorithm, defined as one that meets the following criteria [29], [30]"
Prostate_Cancer "be able to learn additional information from new data. not require access to the original data used to train the existing classifier. preserve previously acquired knowledge. The main contribution of our framework is the implementation and evaluation of an incremental learning algorithm based on [30], which uses an ensemble algorithm inspired from Freund and Schapire�s adaptive boosting algorithm (Adaboost.M1) [31]. A random subspace method [32] was also implemented for the selection of features. Biological studies have shown that ensemble classifiers with SVM outperform single and balanced SVM [33]�[36]. Ensemble methods are one of the most promising solutions to many biological problems and together with SVM, as base classifier, further improvement in recognition of prostate cancer can be achieved. In this study we present a pattern recognition system to estimate the probability of prostate cancer using a multimodal data set from a real clinical environment. Materials and Methods Patient Data Set The institutional review board (Institute for Clinical Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University) approved this retrospective study. Patient information was anonymized and de-identified prior to any analysis. We used data of 12 patients from a clinical environment (full spectrum) with ages between 52 and 75 years, Gleason pattern of 3 and 4 with Gleason scores between 6 and 8. The data set contained in most cases other glandular non-cancerous prostate conditions like prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic atrophy. The patients did not undergo any treatment before the acquisition of MR images. Treatments such as hormone therapy, previous biopsy or brachytherapy [12], [37], [38] tend to alter intensity values of the images, resulting in a drastically diminished ability to determine a threshold between cancer and benign intensity values. Acquisition of the MRI Data Set The data set included MRI transversal slices with three modalities: T2-weighted, Dynamic-Contrast Enhanced plasma flow (DCE-PF) and DCE mean transit time (DCE-MTT). The three MRI modalities were acquired with a mean time of 45 minutes without interruption. This process aids to minimize tissue deformation and motion artifacts between the different MR images. A 3.0T scanner (Magnetom Trio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used with a body phased array coil combined with an endorectal coil (Medrad Medical Systems, Volkach, Germany). The T2-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: TR/TE?=?4000/101 ms; Size of matrix?=?320�320; echo-train length (ETL)?=?25; Pixel bandwidth?=?200 Hz; Field of view (FOV)?=?20 cm; Pixel spacing?=?0.625/0.625 mm; Slice thickness?=?3 mm; Sequence type?=?TSE. The acquisition parameters for DCE were: TR/TE?=?193/1.02 ms; Size of matrix?=?384�388; Field of view (FOV)?=?39 cm; Pixel spacing?=?1.015/1.015 mm; Slice thickness?=?6 mm; Sequence type?=?2D TurboFlash T1; Flip angle?=?9. The parametric maps, plasma flow and mean transit time were calculated using the open source perfusion analysis tool UMMPerfusion [39]. The DCE examination was performed after bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of gadolinium chelate (Dotarem; Guerbet, Roissy CdG Cedex, France) with a bolus velocity of 2.5 mL/s using a power injector (Medrad Inc, Pittsburgh, PA), followed by a saline flush of 40 mL. Histological Data Set The group of patients had histologically confirmed cancer. The elapsed time between the acquisition of the MR images and the prostatectomy was less than 24 hours which minimizes tissue deformation artifacts, and low correlation between the pathological reports and the MR images due to anatomical movements [37], [40]. The histological report consists of different prostate cuts starting from the apex, middle and basis prostate region, separated in the right and left gland, serially sectioned according to a modified Stanford protocol [41]. A pathologist marked the corresponding cancer regions on each of the corresponding cuts. Description of the System This subsection outlines the components of the system. In Figure 1 the workflow of the pattern recognition system is shown. The two main phases of learning and classification are indicated in the figure. The pre-processing and feature extraction blocks were used in both phases. The datasets and the corresponding code are freely available upon request. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.g001 Figure 1 Framework Workflow. Sequence of the system components and overall organization for the estimation of prostate cancer. Ground Truth Labels: Labels of ground truth (GT) are necessary for the training and the evaluation of a supervised classifier. An experienced radiologist traced cancer regions on MR images, section by section, with the marked regions by a pathologist. A total database of 41 slices with about 70 cancerous ROIs from all twelve patients was used as ground truth. Pre-Processing:"
Prostate_Cancer "Three steps were involved, a B-Spline interpolation for re-sampling of data, in which each pixel in different modalities corresponds to the same spatial location, a bias field correction using a variation of the nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization algorithm (N3) and a landmark-based intensity standardization to minimize the intensity variation between slices. Feature Extraction: Structural and functional information corresponding to T2-weighted, DCE-MTT and DCE-PF imaging was used, as well as first-order statistical descriptors (median, standard deviation, skewness, uniformity and average entropy), second-order descriptors using a neighboring gray level dependent matrix (NGLDM) and a neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM). To extract frequency signatures a rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) was implemented. Training: The construction of a model to automate and formalize the pattern recognition process was implemented using a pixel-based supervised learning technique employing an ensemble SVM with the corresponding extension to the non-separable case [42]. Classification and Probability Map: The last step in the inductive inference process was the prediction/classification using the optimal model obtained after training. The posterior probability was also estimated to present the corresponding probability map. Evaluation: The results were evaluated on accuracy, precision and efficiency as well as statistical significance. A methodology was also implemented to assess the results using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and to achieve an optimal generalized answer. In the following subsections, we describe in detail the individual steps of our system. Ground Truth Labels Ground truth (GT) labels for the learning phase was extracted using the annotations of an expert radiologist following the histological reports of a pathologist. The same process has been used in many investigations for the generation of GT [12], [23], [43] in cases where the conditions of clinical data are not suitable to perform an automatic registration. An expert radiologist can recognize landmarks such as morphology of central and peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate, urethra, seminal vesicle, calcifications, etc. These landmarks help to recognize and trace benign and malignant regions in MRI. However, delineation still remains a difficult task for a human observer. Therefore, considering the recommendation of [44], a methodology for manual segmentation to minimize variation in the delineation process was followed (see Fig. 2): 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.g002 Figure 2 Ground Truth marks annotated over MRI modalities. Left a T2-weighted image, in the middle a DCE-MTT image and right a DCE-PF image are shown. The green line marks the peripheral zone (PZ), the red line marks the histologically confirmed cancer region and a sample of benign region is marked by a cyan line. Tracing: Regions of interest (ROI) were traced using Osirix software [45]. The ROIs were annotated on the T2-weighted images because of its high resolution and to facilitate anatomy recognition. Magnification factor: We used a fixed factor (1?800) for all data sets to annotate the ROIs. Window/level value: The window width and center in the T2-weighted images were fixed depending on the minimal and maximal gray value in each volume. Peripheral zone (PZ): Only areas inside the PZ were assessed. The radiologist performed the corresponding annotation of this zone on T2-weighted images. We gave special attention to the PZ not only to reduce high bias produced by non-cancerous prostate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia located in the central zone [4], [46], [47], but also the PZ constitutes over 70% of the glandular prostate [46] and 65%�74% of the prostate tumor nodules are located in this zone [48]. After the annotations by the radiologist on T2-weighted images, the corresponding masked images constituting the ground truth were extracted. One precondition to minimize mislabeled pixels in the ground truth was the selection of a minimum size of cancer. Haider [40] pointed out that tumor sizes greater than 0.13 cm2 are sufficient to detect significant cancer areas. Therefore sizes of cancer larger than 0.1 cm2 were employed in this study. Pre-Processing During image acquisition, an affine transformation matrix was recorded describing the spatial location (translation, direction and rotation) of each data set. Based on the transformation, a spatial re-sampling of the data sets DCE-MTT, DCE-PF was performed using ITK Toolkit [49] to obtain a new image in the same spatial space as the T2-weighted data. B-Spline interpolation was employed in the re-sampling to improve registration. The PZ of the prostate suffers from a corruption of intensity values. To correct bias field artifact a variation of the popular nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm [50], [51] was used. The algorithm, named �N4ITK�, connects a robust B-Spline algorithm with a multiresolution optimization which demonstrated a superior performance [52]. The parameters were set following the recommendation of [53]. Figure 3 illustrates an example of an image with the calculated bias field superimposed. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.g003 Figure 3 MRI Bias field correction. Left an uncorrected image, in the middle the corrected image and right image with the calculated bias field superimposed. Another bias factor in MRI is non-standardness between slices. To overcome intensity variation a landmark-based method [54], [55] was applied because of its efficiency and accuracy [56]. The basic premise of a landmark-based method is to find a mapping based on the median and percentiles that deforms the histogram of an input image to match a reference. The mapping is performed linearly and independently per segments using three landmarks. The landmark-based method consisted of two steps. First, a training step was executed only once for a given modality. The histogram was computed for each slice in a volume, where is the total number of slices. The median intensity () and the intensities corresponding to the 0 and 99.8 percentile () of were computed (see [54] for details). "
Prostate_Cancer "After that, the median was mapped to the standard scale () (equation 1).(1) Finally, the mean value of mapped medians of each slice was computed. The second step was the transformation of the intensity. In the transformation step, again the median intensity () and intensities corresponding to the 0 and 99.8 percentile () of were calculated. The intensity values for each pixel were mapped to a new value :(2) Finally, the set of images were normalized using z-scores such that intensity values have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Feature Extraction A total of 32 features corresponding to structure (T2-weighted images () ), functional (DCE-MTT (), DCE-PF () images) and statistical texture features were used to describe the appearance and shape of the intensity distributions of prostate structures. Texture information was extracted from the structural T2-weighted images. Madabhushi [13] mentioned the importance of first- and second-order statistical features to improve the classification results. We consider some additional first-order descriptors of the intensity histogram based on [57]. We computed five operators with two windows sizes () to get information on the median intensity (), dispersion (), skewness (), smoothness () and variability () using the following operators respectively: Median () Standard deviation () Third moment ()(3) Energy ()(4) Entropy ()(5) The operators were computed for each pixel in all slices of a volume. contains the -neighborhood pixels centered on and is the mean of . refers to the probability distribution of surrounding pixels. Second-order statistical features were extracted using two angular independent approaches, a neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) and a neighboring gray level dependent matrix (NGLDM). In NGTDM, the matrix is set using the equation 6, with .(6) The array contains all pixels with gray value , is the number of pixels in . is the mean value over a neighborhood centered at, but excluding . Five operators were computed with the NGT matrix (Coarseness (), Contrast (), Busyness (), Complexity () and Texture Strength ()) [17]. These operators quantify the difference between regions with different intensity levels, the spatial frequency of intensity changes from one pixel to its neighbor and the magnitude of the difference between two intensity values, weighting the difference with their probabilities of occurrence. For NGLM, equation 7 describes the implementation of matrix . For a given image of size with pixel and , there is a matrix , where c is the intensity value and the number of repetitions of .(7) The neighborhood was defined by , where is the windows size (). The points are the coordinates to localize the pixel . The symbol # denotes the number of elements in the set, is the distance between the elements and , and defines the similarity between two pixels (a?=?10). Three operators were computed using the matrix (Number Nonuniformity (), Second Moment () and Entropy ()) [18]. To extract frequency signatures, a rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) implemented by Ojansivu [22] was integrated into the system (the Matlab implementation is available at the Outex site http://www.outex.oulu.). It is based on the blur invariance property of the Fourier phase spectrum. The phase information was extracted from a local k-neighborhood with k?=?3, centered on a pixel x of a subimage I(x). The local spectra was computed with a short-term Fourier transform (STFT) defined by equation 8.(8) Where u is the frequency, and is a circular Gaussian function. A 2-D rotation matrix () with an angle was used to rotate the images and the circular local neighborhood (36 different angles were generated). The local Fourier coefficients were computed and the phase information was recorded by observing the sign of the imaginary parts of the coefficients� vector. The resulting values were normalized to a range of 0 to 15. A RI-LPQ histogram of these values with 16 bins was composed and used as 16 additional features ( to ) for each pixel in the classification. Training The advantage of an incremental learning algorithm lies in the ability to incrementally learn additional information from new data when it becomes available. We implemented an ensemble algorithm based on [30]. The ensemble classifiers were trained based on a dynamically updated distribution over the training data points, in which points that are difficult to classify receive a higher probability to increase their chance of being selected into the next training data set. The algorithm uses a database where corresponds to the number of patients available (in our case 12 patients). "
Prostate_Cancer "The data points of all patients were first randomly permuted and split into K?=?12 equal-sized parts. As base classifier the non-separable case formulation of SVM was employed, which will be referred to 1C-SVM. The aim of training using 1C-SVM was to construct an optimal hypotheses , separating two classes and maximizing the distance to the closet point from either class [58], which is robust against model misspecification and provides a high predictive power. The main concept is finding an optimal hyperplane in the feature space using the formulation in equation (9).(9)where maps into a higher-dimentional space, is a regularization hyper-parameter that penalizes misclassification. is a slack variable to relax the constraints and is called margin error or misclassification error. The equation (9) can be solved with a quadratic programming solution using the lagrangian dual objective functions [59]. By using the dual objective function is possible to use the kernel trick , which maps data into higher dimensions in order to handle non-linear relationships between patterns. The mapping to a higher dimensionality also permits the capture of similarities between data points. A Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) was used as a kernel, given by equation (10).(10) is a hyper-parameter which changes the smoothness of the kernel function i.e. a greater or lesser relationship between the data points is found depending on the value of . To estimate the optimal hyper-parameter and for 1C-SVM the heuristic method Nelder-Mead was used [60], [61]. The selected criteria to find the optimal classifier was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) which is commonly used in medical decision making, and is useful for organizing classifiers and used increasingly in machine learning and data mining [59], [62]. The inputs to the ensemble algorithm are: training data . It consists of training data points with being the -dimensional features and indicating the corresponding class. The data points are randomly selected from the database ; a base classifier to generate a hypotheses . A requirement on the base classifier is that it obtains a correct classification performance on its own training data set. an integer specifying the number of iterations to be generated for each data set. were employed, which was enough to reduce the prediction error. The ensemble algorithm starts by initializing a set of weights for the training data , and a distribution obtained from . According to the training data is divided into a training subset and a test subset at the iteration of the algorithm. Without a priori information the distribution of weights is initially set to be uniform. At each iteration , the weights adjusted at iteration are divided by the sum of all to ensure a legitimate distribution and a new is obtained. Training and test subsets are drawn randomly according to , and the SVM is trained using tenfold CV method. A hypothesis is obtained as the classifier, whose error (11) is computed on the entire data set .(11) The error is required to be less than 0.5 to ensure a reasonable performance of . If the condition is satisfied, is accepted and the error is normalized to obtain the normalization error (12)(12) If the condition is not satisfied, then the current is discarded, and a new training subset is selected. All hypotheses generated so far are then combined using the weighted majority voting to obtain the composite hypothesis (13), which allows efficient incremental learning capability when new classes are introduced. The hypothesis with good performance are awarded a higher voting weight.(13) The error of the composite hypothesis is computed with (14), and must also be less than 0.5 to ensure a reasonable performance of , otherwise the algorithm discards the composite hypothesis and returns to select a new training subset.(14) The normalized composite error is then computed with (15).(15) To reduce the weights of those data points that are correctly classified by the composite hypothesis and lower the probability of being selected in the next training subset, the rule of equation 16 is used.(16) The hypothesis for the training subset and the subset of features can be obtained by combining all hypotheses that have been generated so far using the weighted majority voting rule (17).(17) The features for use in the classifier was performed with a pairwise correlation using the spearman�s coefficients [63] avoiding multicollinearity. Features with a correlation coefficient lower than 0.60 were integrated in the pattern recognition system. Furthermore, a sequential forward methodology, leaving out the features that did not decrease significantly the prediction error, was employed. Another method for the selection of features is a generalization of the random forest algorithm, known as random subspace ensemble [32], which perform better when the features have high correlation."
Prostate_Cancer "A random subspace of incremental learning SVM for each training subset was implemented. The method randomly selected different subsets of features to train each classifier. Given the training subset , a subspace was chosen with features. We employed and of the total number of features. All subspaces of incremental learning SVM were trained and combined using a weighted majority voting rule. To implement a random subspace the equation 17 was redefined as follow:(18) The normalized error (19) was calculated with the mean square error (mse) of the hypothesis . The final hypothesis is computed with weighted majority voting (20).(19)(20) Classification and Probability Map The classification output of the SVM are decision values indicating the distance of data points to the hyper-plane without an estimation of how likely a data point belongs to a class, which is more important in a medical routine. We applied an extension of LIBSVM [42], which is an improvement of Platt [64], to give a probability estimation of cancer based on Lin et al. [65] and Wu et al. [66]. The extension proposes approximating the posterior probability by a sigmoid function using decision values and labels of each data point. Finally, the probability map estimation was saved in DICOM files for posterior analysis and diagnosis by the physicians. Evaluation To achieve an objective evaluation, the following methodology was implemented. The data set was divided into three subsets: training, validation and test. The aim of the validation subset was to make a fair estimation of performance, independent of the test data, and to pick optimal parameters that maximize the performance of the validation subset which in turn provides a more generalized solution. We implemented a nested cross-validation (CV) method for an unbiased estimation of prediction error in an independent test data. As used in [14], [15] threefold CV was used for the evaluation of the classifier, i.e. 8 patient studies were used for training and validation and 4 patient studies for independent testing. To estimate the unknown tuning parameters of the classifier tenfold CV was used with data points from the 8 studies selected for training and validation. The data points were randomly permuted and divided in 10 parts, one part for the validation and nine for training. The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used as performance measure which provides a representation of the probability that a randomly chosen disease subject is correctly ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-disease subject [67]. Since in other approaches other statistical measures of performance for binary classification were used, we also computed statistical measures, such as the sensitivity (TPR) and specificity (SPC) (21,22) as complementary information. To obtain binary classification a thresholding procedure is used. We selected a threshold such that a data point is classified as cancerous if the posterior probability , otherwise is classified as non-cancerous. Several threshold values were selected and the balanced accuracy (BAC), which is defined as the mean of sensitivity and specificity, was computed for each of the threshold values. The selected is the one which produced the maximum BAC value. The use of TPR and SPC yielded additional information about the performance of the classifier and allowed comparison of our results with other approaches. Additional measures like the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) (23) and the area under the PPV-TPR curve (AUC-PPV/TPR), known in machining learning as Precision-Recall curve, were also computed to give further information about performance on the positive class (cancer structure). PPV is also significant because it is also related with a priori chance of extra-capsular disease [37].(21)(22)(23)TP and TN denote the number of true positive and true negative data points, respectively. FP and FN denote the number of false positive and false negative data points, respectively. To evaluate the significance of the results between different models we used the Friedman test [68], which is a non-parametric statistical test that analyzes the ranked samples of an experiment and detects differences between the models across multiple test attempts. The p-value as a measure of statistical significance allows to reject or to accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference between experiments [69]. A p-value lower than 0.05 rejects the null hypothesis and the test is statistically significant, between 0.05 and 0.1 is marginal significant and higher than 0.1 is not statistically significant. Results Feature generation, texture analysis, standardization, normalization, data cleaning, bootstrapping and evaluation methodology were implemented using Matlab 7.10 software. Training, prediction and the extensions of 1C-SVM were computed with LIBSVM C++ code [42]. To speed up the CV process and classification phase we implemented the code using the parallel computing toolbox of Matlab and the Grid Cluster infrastructure of Baden - Wuerttemberg bwGRID [70]. The results of accuracy, precision and efficiency are presented using the mean and standard deviation. We present also the corresponding box plots to give additional statistical information. The computational time reported was running the classifications on a PC with an Intel Core i7 CPU at 3.4 GHz and 16 GB of RAM. Performance of a Single 1C-SVM A single 1C-SVM was run to compare the results with the proposed method. This classifier was implemented in other approaches for prostate classification giving good results [12], [23], [25], [26]. The features were selected according to the spearman�s coefficients and the sequential forward approach. The features that significantly improved the AUC-ROC were the first-order texture descriptors: standard deviation, third moment and energy. We compared three models using different configurations. The first model contained only values of T2-weighted images (T2), the second includes T2-weighted, DCE-MTT, DCE-PF (T2DCE) and the third model consisted of T2 and its most significant texture features (T2Tex).

The computational time given in minutes was the time required for the training and validation phase. Mislabeled pixels or extreme intensity variations can be present in the training dataset. The identification of outliers in high-dimension for each class, without any assumption on the distribution, is challenging. To avoid deviant observation we used One-class SVM [42] in each class independently for each patient dataset. The parameters and , using a radial basis function, were optimized with Nelder-Mead. The training data set is subject to imbalance, known as minority class, that can cause class representation problems. Bootstrap over-sampling was used to balance the number of data points in each class for each patient. Bootstraping to enlarge the sampling pool [71] was performed with a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm [72]. The algorithm chose uniformly distributed pseudorandom data with replacement. To obtain a preferred sample size, the non-cancerous regions were undersampled, while the cancerous regions were oversampled until both classes were balanced. The algorithm was run for each patient independently. Another method to overcome the minority class problem is a cost-sensitive SVM [42] to penalize misclassification asymmetrically. However, we did not get a significant improvement compared to stratified sampling. For simplicity and reducing computing cost, we used the bootstrap sampling to balance the number of data points. Table 2 illustrates the results using a single 1C-SVM with a processed training dataset. Comparing table 1 and 2, the difficulties of a single SVM to handle outliers and an imbalanced data set can be observed. Including methods to avoid outliers and balance the data set contribute to enhance the performance of a single SVM. However, these procedures and a large number of samples introduced a significant computational cost during the training phase. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.t002 Table 2 Classifier�s performance for a single 1C-SVM with a processed training dataset. Measures () T2 T2DCE T2Tex TPR SPC PPV AUC-ROC AUC-PPV/TPR Time(min) Three different combinations of features T2, T2DCE, T2Tex were assessed using the metrics TPR?=?Sensitivity, SPC?=?Specificity, PPV?=?Positive Predictive Value, AUC-ROC?=?Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and AUC-PPV/TPR?=?Area under the Precision-Recall curve. The computational time given in minutes was the time required for the training and validation phase. Evaluation of the Incremental Learning Algorithm The same three models were compared (T2, T2DCE and T2Tex). Table 3 shows the results using the ensemble framework. The method based on Platt [42] to estimate the probability of cancer was implemented. We also used the decision values of SVM without the extension based on Platt to confirm the results. The AUC-ROC?=?0.870�0.103 and AUC-PPV/TPR?=?0.461�0.247 using the decision values did not present a significant difference. The model with T2-weighted and first-order texture descriptors (T2Tex) had the highest accuracy with an AUC-ROC significantly better than the T2 and T2DCE models (), by highlighting relationship between pixels. Although T2 presented the highest sensitivity, T2Tex improved the trade-off between sensitivity, specificity and PPV values, which is more meaningful in clinical routines. T2DCE did not provide any significant improvement in performance. Figure 4 illustrates the box plot of these results. In comparison with table 2, the results of table 3 were not significantly different, however the ensemble 1C-SVM did not require a processed training data set, demonstrating that it is more robust in the presence of outliers and the imbalance in data than a single SVM. Furthermore, the computational cost in the training phase was a quarter of the time compared to a single SVM. A random subset of features was also evaluated, however we did not obtain a significant improvement (AUC-ROC?=?0.848�0.083) and the computing time increased by a factor of 10. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.g004 Figure 4 Classification results using an ensemble 1C-SVM.

The computational time given in minutes was the time required for the training and validation phase. Assessment of the Classifier According to the Area of Cancer Structures Recognition of cancer in the PZ is challenging, due to the presence of other glandular non-cancerous prostate conditions, different stages and sizes of cancer. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the framework using the two best models: T2 and T2Tex according to the size of cancer. Table 4 summarizes the results for two different sizes of cancer ( and ). T2Tex performed better in AUC-ROC and AUC-PPV/TPR, for both small (A) and big areas (B), than T2, as well as a better trade-off between sensitivity, specificity and PPV. Texture information contributed also to identify suspect structures with different stages and sizes. In case of small areas (A) the false positive rate was higher and demonstrated discrimination complexity between small cancer areas and normal or other glandular non-cancerous prostate conditions. In case of big areas (B) the results were similar for both models. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.t004 Table 4 Classifier�s performance for different sizes of cancer structures.

Prostate_Cancer "Region A corresponds to cancer structures between and region B corresponds to cancer structures between . Five patients per region were evaluated. Evaluation of Ensemble 1C-SVM Against Human Experts For comparison, two radiologists marked only cancer regions for five different patients (around 15 slices) in T2 images observing the usual MRI modalities and following normal evaluation routines (without any knowledge of the pathology or previous diagnosis). After the segmentation of cancer structures the results were evaluated against the ground truth. Similarly, the results of the automatic classification for the selected test patient were evaluated against the ground truth. Table 5 shows the comparison of cancer structures segmented by a radiologist and results obtained by our system. In terms of PPV, the radiologist can discern with more accuracy anatomical tissue or other non-cancerous prostate conditions that overlap with cancer structures. An expert who is familiarized with structures and shapes and prior knowledge about the meaning of other structures can further reduce the false positive rate. The sensitivity in the results by the human expert exemplifies the challenging nature of interpreting and staging prostate cancer. The human expert has to handle a variety of MRI modalities, MRI intensity variation artifacts and confined time for analysis. Our system helps to improve the sensitivity and decrease the time to recognize and delineate cancer regions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.t005 Table 5 Evaluation of classifier against human experts. Measures () Observer 1 Observer 2 CAS TPR PPV Time(sec) Five patients were evaluated by two radiologists and by the computer-aided system (CAS) using T2Tex. The performance was measured using TPR?=?Sensitivity and PPV?=?Positive Predictive Value. The time required to evaluate, recognize and delineate prostate cancer is given in seconds. Qualitative Evaluation Figure 5 illustrates the results after classification of two test patients using an ensemble 1C-SVM with T2Tex as features. A correlation between ground truth and classification results was observed on slices containing histological information. In neighbor slices was also observed evidence of cancer. These slices do not have histological data because of loss of information during the histology process for the extraction of prostate tissue. Nevertheless, the possibility of cancer in neighbor slices is evident due to the irregularities in shape and spread characteristics of cancer. The major number of T2-weighted slices together with the classification model contributes to locating suspicious cancer structures along the inter-slice direction. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.g005 Figure 5 Recognition of cancer structures for two clinical patients. Five slices corresponding to the MRI volume of each patient are illustrated. The probability map was superimposed over the T2-weighted images. The background represents the gray values of the T2-weighted images for the whole prostate tissue. In the foreground the probability estimation of cancer is shown using a color map only over the PZ for the corresponding slices. The probability of cancer is ranged on a color scale: red ( probability), yellow-green ( probability), without color (lower than probability of cancer). The white marks highlight the ground truth regions. In the presence of other non-cancerous prostate conditions, ensemble 1C-SVM classified these regions as suspicious tissue with a probability of cancer between to , but the results depend on the stage of these prostatic conditions (e.g. first patient in the fifth slice on right side). We trained the classifier with pixels inside the PZ. If regions outside the PZ or other prostate tissue (e.g ejaculatory ducts or neurovascular bundle) are classified, the results are meaningless. These regions have an overlap with cancer structures and were not included in the training. Images such as the first and the second slice of patient 2 have to be assessed in detail with the radiologist and the pathologist to verify if this result was a statistical error of the classifier or a systematic error because of mislabeled data. Discussion In this work we present the feasibility of developing an ensemble 1C-SVM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic classifier for recognition of prostate cancer that uses incremental learning algorithms satisfying the criteria of being able to learn additional information from new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge and preventing the unlearning [28] of old or underrepresented patterns. Moreover, the training phase does not need to be initiated from scratch when new data becomes available, actually it does not require access to the data used to train the existing classifier at all. This framework makes possible not only the integration of new discriminant features, but also accommodation of new classes that may be introduced with new data. As mentioned in [25], [26], a comparison between study results is difficult because of differences between study population. In addition, each study has a different amount of data in which artifacts in the MR images and imbalances between cancer and benign data points are presented. Other differences involve annotations that do not follow same standards (e.g. classification of pixels, voxels, sextant), the discrimination task (e.g. using cancerous and normal tissue or normal tissue together with other non-cancerous conditions) and the evaluation methodology. We can report that with our framework an ensemble 1C-SVM renders a AUC-ROC of 0.864 (95% confidence interval(CI)?=?0.847�0.880), sensitivity of 0.844 (95% CI?=?0.819�0.868) and specificity of 0.780 (95% CI?=?0.767�0.794), which is superior or similar to results reported in other studies [12], [14]. These studies were evaluated using leave-one-out (LOO), nevertheless it is known that LOO has a high variance [59]. Table 6 summarizes our results using both three-fold CV and LOO, as well as the results of current approaches. The dataset used for other studies is described as follows: Artan [25] used 21 slices from 21 patients. Niaf [26] experimented with 30 patients taking 42 cancerous ROIs. Tiwari [15] employed 29 patients and performed a classification per metavoxel. 10.1371/journal.pone.0093600.t006 Table 6 Summary of current studies and our system results. Measures(%) Artan Niaf Tiwari OurFramework TPR 64.0 � � 84.40/84.69 SPC 78.0 � � 78.03/78.62 PPV � � � 29.29/29.38 AUC-ROC 79.0 89.0 85.0/89.0 86.38/86.85 AUC-PPV/TPR � � � 44.53/46.69 The computer-aided studies from Artan [25], Niaf [26] used a leave-one-out (LOO) CV methodology, and from Tiwari [15] which, similar to this paper, used three-fold CV/LOO. Our results are reported for both methods three-fold CV/LOO. The metrics used are: TPR?=?Sensitivity, SPC?=?Specificity, PPV?=?Positive Predictive Value, AUC-ROC?=?Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and AUC-PPV/TPR?=?Area under the Precision-Recall curve. The analysis of cancerous structures is not trivial, they are characterized by their lack of shape and their overlap with other tissues (e.g. non-cancerous prostate conditions, and even healthy tissue). Moreover, the degree of intensity overlap depends also on the stage and size of malignant regions [9], [46] and together with the anatomy that change from patient to patient, makes the discrimination between benign and cancer tissue more difficult. Our results suggest that a more straightforward and efficient approach using first-order texture features is sufficient to achieve significant improvement in the recognition of cancer. Indeed, Niaf [26] demonstrated that using all extracted features would lead to poor performance. The degraded performance in our results using second-order features could reflect the differences in stage and size of malignant regions and the presence of other prostate conditions. However, other studies [13]�[15] suggest that second-order features yield good results. An evaluation of second-order angular independent features with a larger database containing more cancer regions (e.g. in different stages or different sizes) could help to assess the importance of these features in the classification. A random subspace of features did not improve the results of the incremental leaning algorithm. In Kuncheva [73] was reported a modest improvement using random subspaces depending on the data set. A restrictive choice of features and a higher number of random subspaces could help to increase the performance, but it implies higher computational cost, and we did not find evidence suggesting that a better choice of and could improve the results significantly. The data set was pre-processed to increase the performance of the classifier and robustness of the system. A general drawback of previous publications is the limited focus on pre-processing the data to minimize artifacts and deviations, e.g. the corruption of intensity values in the peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate near to the rectum caused by sharp near field endorectal coil artifacts [12], [74] and the intensity variations between slices in MR imaging, known as non-standardness [54], [55], [75]. High signal intensity artifacts can not only limit the detection of cancer in the PZ, but also decrease the ability to generalize, which in most cases has not received appropriate attention in medical image applications. "
Prostate_Cancer "Although, these intensity variations have usually little impact on visual diagnosis, they significantly affect the performance of many image processing and analysis techniques based on absolute pixel intensities [76]�[78]. The ensemble workflow is similar to the decision process. A human being tends to seek several opinions before making any important decision. Individual opinions are weighted and combined to obtain a final decision [79]. This workflow offers higher accuracy and stability when compared to a single classifier. In addition, ensemble algorithms can often alleviate the problems of small sample size and high dimensionality which commonly occur in many bioinformatics applications [80]. The algorithm using ensemble 1C-SVM is also easy to implement and converges much faster than a single classifier because the ensemble algorithm does not use a large database for the training phase. Managing and analyzing huge databases implies computing complexity, storage problems and poor classification accuracy due to difficulties in finding correct classifiers [81], i.e. the size of the search space increases and underrepresented patterns that depend on the changing anatomy from patient to patient, may go undetected. The incremental learning algorithm also demonstrates a more generalized performance and a narrow confidence interval, which indicates improved stability and robustness. Furthermore, this suits the working conditions in medical applications, in which a representative data set is difficult and time consuming to obtain. Data sets often become available in small and separate batches at different times. The base classifier 1C-SVM method using the Gaussian Radial function also renders good results. The optimization process to find the hyper-parameters, together with the use of a radial kernel, was crucial to obtain higher accuracy. A Gaussian function can better characterize the similarities between cancer structures and neighbor pixels, which correspond in fact to the standard deviation of the intensity values. A default parameter depending on the number of features, as used in other studies, is not an optimal choice to find similarities between structures. A heuristic method, such as Nelder-Mead, is a better choice for model selection, however a poor starting point can lead to a local search. We suggest to first run a loose search to select the starting point, and then run Nelder-Mead for a precise search. The results using areas of cancer confirmed the positive performance of our system for different sizes of cancer structures. In addition, we observed that in the presence of larger malignant structures, other regions such as the central zone or tissue outside the prostate capsule were also affected by cancer. This observation suggests that the PPV value is related to the chance of extra-capsular disease, as mentioned also in [37]. Our results demonstrated that inclusion of the functional features used in this study: DCE parameters, plasma flow (PF) and mean transit time (MTT) do not improve the classification results. However, Vos et al. [24] demonstrated the contribution of different DCE parameters, such as T1Static, Ve in the extravascular and extracellular space, transfer constant () and rate constant (). These DCE parameters have to be assessed with our system, which may improve the performance differentiating cancer and benign tissue. Other functional features such as Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and MR-Spectroscopy have been evaluated [9]�[11], [15]. However, we do not integrate these features because of high bias and noise within the available data which are produced by artifacts in these modalities. In our study, the ground truth was created manually by visual correlation of the histological sections with the MRI slices. There was not enough available information to perform an automatic registration, this is an important point to improve in the future. Nevertheless, visual correlation is still an acceptable method that has been used in other technical and clinical publications [12], [13], [15], [24], [26], [27]. Further investigations are necessary such as including more functional features in the system, increasing the number of patients and improving the extraction of ground truth. The integration of a third class corresponding to other non-cancerous prostate conditions is also important, for which the incremental learning algorithm can be improved e.g. using other combination rules or adding prior information in the ensemble to increase the performance. Conclusion A pattern recognition system using an incremental learning algorithm and texture information for the automatic classification of prostatic adenocarcinoma, was presented. Our system not only suits the complex working conditions in medical applications, but also learns additional information from new data preventing unlearning. The performance, effectiveness and robustness of the system, along with its simplicity and speed in training as well in classification was also presented. Moreover, our system operates with a low number of features (T2-Weighted and texture operators)"
Prostate_Cancer "Purpose of Review The field of prostate cancer therapeutics has undergone a rapid and dramatic change in the last few years. Multiple agents with very distinct mechanisms of actions and unique toxicities and efficacies have become available for clinical use. The focus of this review is to give a summary of clinical perspectives of the indications, including pros and cons of the currently approved regimens. The next generation of novel targets and agents are also highlighted. Recent Findings Addition of docetaxel based chemotherapy to conventional androgen suppression therapy in hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer demonstrated overall survival benefit in recently released results of ECOG 3805. In castrate resistant metastatic disease, development of novel immunotherapy (Sipuleucel T), chemotherapy (docetaxel and cabazitaxel), radiation (alpharadin) and hormone therapy (abiraterone and enzalutamide) agents has created a range of choices for treatment, palliation and improved life expectancy. Summary A paradigm shift has occurred in the management of advanced prostate cancer, with multiple novel agents addressing distinct pathways, and demonstrating powerful efficacy. The judicious use of the available agents, with finesse of sequencing, and concomitant palliative care has prolonged survival and made living with the disease more reasonable and tolerable.

The overexpression of KDM4A/KDM4B in prostate cancer and their association with androgen receptor suggest that KDM4A/KDM4B are potential progression factors for prostate cancer. Here, we report the crystal structure of the KDM4B�pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylic acid�H3K9me3 ternary complex, revealing the core active-site region and a selective K9/K36 site. A selective KDM4A/KDM4B inhibitor, 4, that occupies three subsites in the binding pocket is identified by virtual screening. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of KDM4A/KDM4B significantly blocks the viability of cultured prostate cancer cells, which is accompanied by increased H3K9me3 staining and transcriptional silencing of growth-related genes. Significantly, a substantial portion of differentially expressed genes are AR-responsive, consistent with the roles of KDM4s as critical AR activators. Our results point to KDM4 as a useful therapeutic target and identify a new inhibitor scaffold.

Purpose To investigate boosting dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) in the context of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) and to examine the impact on tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Methods and Materials Ten prostate datasets were selected. DILs were defined using T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Four plans were produced for each dataset: (1) no boost to DILs; (2) boost to DILs, no seminal vesicles in prescription; (3) boost to DILs, proximal seminal vesicles (proxSV) prescribed intermediate dose; and (4) boost to DILs, proxSV prescribed higher dose. The prostate planning target volume (PTV) prescription was 42.7 Gy in 7 fractions. DILs were initially prescribed 115% of the PTVProstate prescription, and PTVDIL prescriptions were increased in 5% increments until organ-at-risk constraints were reached. TCP and NTCP calculations used the LQ-Poisson Marsden, and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models respectively. Results When treating the prostate alone, the median PTVDIL prescription was 125% (range: 110%-140%) of the PTVProstate prescription. Median PTVDIL D50% was 55.1 Gy (range: 49.6-62.6 Gy). The same PTVDIL prescriptions and similar PTVDIL median doses were possible when including the proxSV within the prescription. TCP depended on prostate ?/? ratio and was highest with an ?/? ratio = 1.5 Gy, where the additional TCP benefit of DIL boosting was least. Rectal NTCP increased with DIL boosting and was considered unacceptably high in 5 cases, which, when replanned with an emphasis on reducing maximum dose to 0.5 cm3 of rectum (Dmax0.5cc), as well as meeting existing constraints, resulted in considerable rectal NTCP reductions. Conclusions Boosting DILs in the context of SABR is technically feasible but should be approached with caution. If this therapy is adopted, strict rectal constraints are required including Dmax0.5cc. If the ?/? ratio of prostate cancer is 1.5 Gy or less, then high TCP and low NTCP can be achieved by prescribing SABR to the whole prostate, without the need for DIL boosting. Summary Delivering prostate stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) with simultaneous boosts to dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) is technically feasible and increases tumor control probability. Boosting DILs increases rectal normal tissue complication probability, although high levels of rectal normal tissue complication probability can be reduced by minimizing maximum rectal doses. If the ?/? ratio for prostate cancer is 1.5 Gy or less, then high tumor control probability and low normal tissue complication probability can be achieved by delivering SABR to the whole prostate without DIL boosting. Introduction External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in prostate cancer (PCa) traditionally considers the whole prostate as the clinical target volume (CTV), without gross tumor volume (GTV) definition. Modern imaging allows identification of dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) (1). These are frequently the source of local failure and can be considered GTVs (2-4). Increased radiation doses in PCa result in increased biochemical control (5), but dose escalation to the whole prostate is limited by the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. An alternative strategy could irradiate the whole prostate but simultaneously escalate dose to the DILs (3). The literature concerning simultaneous EBRT DIL boosts uses conventional fractionation or moderate hypofractionation to treat the prostate and DILs (3,6-13). Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) uses ultrahypofractionation to deliver escalated doses in a small number of treatments. Theoretically, this is radiobiologically advantageous: PCa may have a low ?/? ratio (?1.5 Gy) and thus should be sensitive to high doses per fraction (14). This study investigates boosting DILs using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) within the context of SABR: a SABR dose was prescribed to the prostate with a simultaneous DIL SABR boost. The impact on tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was examined. Methods and Materials Imaging and contouring Ten prostate datasets were selected (the first patients in a pilot study investigating DIL boosting in the context of high-dose-rate [HDR] brachytherapy). Clinical characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table E1. Patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and planning computed tomography (CT) scans within a period of a few hours. MRI datasets were acquired with an Avanto (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) 1.5-T scanner using phased-array pelvic coils and consisted of T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. For DW MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient maps were generated from a single-shot spin echo-echo planar imaging sequence with b values of 0, 150, and 500 s/mm2. For DCE MRI, volume transfer constant (Ktrans) maps were generated by fitting a Tofts (15) 1-compartment model to concentration-time data for 200 acquisitions with temporal resolution 2 s, acquired using a 3-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient echo sequence, with a bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteric acid (Dotarem; Guerbet Group, Villepinte, France) administered at 3 mL/s after 10 s and a patient-specific arterial input function measured in the iliac artery. An experienced radiologist delineated DILs on the MRI sequences based on low-intensity on T2-weighted MRI, low apparent diffusion coefficient map values, and high Ktrans map values, together with the prostate and urethra. The CTVDIL was the combined DIL volume from each MRI sequence (Fig. 1) expanded 4 mm to the PTVDIL. Images were coregistered with the planning CT by using automatic soft tissue matching (nondeformable) with manual alteration if necessary, paying particular attention to the prostate-rectal interface and regions containing DILs. Patients received enemas and were instructed to have full bladders. The rectum, bladder, and femoral heads were contoured as organs-at-risk. The urethra was expanded ?1.5 mm circumferentially to create a urethral planning organ at risk volume (PRV), with a diameter of 5 to 6 mm. The CTVProstate was the prostate alone, expanded 6 mm to PTVProstate. The proximal 1 cm of seminal vesicles (SV) was included in a separate CTV: CTVProstate+SV, expanded 6 mm to PTVProstate+SV. Prescription and coverage The PTVProstate prescription was 42.7 Gy in 7 fractions (intended for delivery on alternate week days over 15 days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Monday). Coverage requirements are shown in Table 1. Plans initially prescribed 42.7 Gy to the prostate without DIL boosts. Plans were then created with simultaneous DIL boosts: the PTVDIL prescription was increased in 5% increments starting at 115% of the PTVProstate prescription until organ-at-risk or conformity constraints were reached. If a boost of 115% was not achievable, the PTVDIL prescription was reduced in 5% increments until the plan became acceptable. Plans were then created that delivered the highest achievable PTVDIL prescription to DILs, 42.7 Gy to the prostate, and that also included the proximal SV (proxSV) within PTVProstate + SV, initially prescribed 32.4 Gy in 7 fractions (equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions [EQD2]"
Prostate_Cancer "1.5 Gy: 56.7 Gy), a microscopic tumoricidal dose, and then 36.5 Gy in 7 fractions (EQD21.5 Gy: 70.0 Gy), a higher dose which may improve tumor control. The prescription doses for both the prostate and DIL PTVs were such that at least 95% of the structure received at least 95% of the prescription dose (ie, D95% ? 95% of prescription dose). To allow gradients for DIL boosting and to maximize PTVDIL doses, there were no limits on dose heterogeneity. Organs-at-risk Constraints are shown in Table 1. Plans Four plans were produced for each dataset, as follows: (1) plan set A: no DIL boost delivery, no SV in prescription; (2) plan set B: boost to DILs, no SV in prescription; (3) plan set C: boost to DILs, proxSV prescribed intermediate dose; and (4) plan set D: boost to DILs, proxSV prescribed higher dose. Planning Monaco version 3.3 (Elekta AB, Sweden) was used with a Monte Carlo algorithm and the Agility multileaf collimator with 5-mm leaves (Elekta AB, Sweden). VMAT was planned with 1 anterior 270� arc (225�?135�) for 9 patients, and 3 partial arcs (290�?70�, 180�?240�, 120�?180�) for 1 patient who had a bilateral hip prostheses. The final plan in each set was calculated using a 2-mm grid. There were 150 control points per arc. Normal tissues took priority over target coverage. Prioritizing individual organs-at-risk is not required in Monaco. Modeling TCP was calculated using the LQ-Poisson Marsden model, originally described by Nahum and Sanchez-Nieto (16), and discussed in the Supplementary Material. Three sets of parameters were used for TCP calculation, each representing a different ?/? ratio: 10 Gy, 3 Gy, and 1.5 Gy (Table 2) (17). Clonogen density in the DIL region was assumed to be 1 � 107 cm?3. Using an approach similar to that reported by Nutting et al (9), we assumed the ratio of clonogens in DIL (s) to clonogens in the non-DIL prostate was 90:10. Clonogen density in the non-DIL prostate was therefore:?=1�107�median_total_DIL_volume_per_prostate�1090median_(prostate-DIL)_volume TCP was calculated using dose-volume histograms (DVH) for the CTVDIL and the non-DIL prostate [ie, (CTVProstate) ? (CTVDIL(s))]. NTCP for the rectum, bladder, and femoral heads was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model (18,19) with Niemierko's equivalent uniform dose (20), as described in Supplementary Material. QUANTEC [Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic] parameters for grade 2 + rectal toxicity or bleeding were adopted for principal rectal NTCP evaluation (21). For further exploration, parameters for severe rectal bleeding and frequency, anal incontinence, and parameters considering the impact of previous abdominal surgery were employed (22). The choice of modeling parameters is discussed in Supplementary Materials. Parameters are shown in Table 3. To assess the sensitivity of TCP calculations to small alterations in input parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed, as described in Supplementary Material. Calculations were performed using Biosuite software (developed at Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, UK) (17) using differential DVHs with 0.1 Gy bin width. Statistics The Wilcoxon signed-rank exact test was used to compare plan parameters, TCP and NTCP as these were non normally distributed. Median values and ranges are therefore presented. The following were compared: plan set B was compared to plan set A, plan set C to plan set B, and plan set D to plan set C. Linear correlations were examined using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). SPSS, version 19, software was used. Tests were 2-tailed. A P value of <.05 was significant. Results A total of 17 PTVDILs were defined (1, 2, and 3 DILs in 5, 3, and 2 cases respectively). Median PTVDIL volume was 3.4 cm3 (range: 1.5-51.6 cm3). Median PTVProstate volume was 61.8 cm3 (range: 38.9-128.5 cm3). When the prostate was treated alone (ie, without proxSV inclusion) and prescribed the highest feasible boost to DILs (plan set B), the median PTVDIL prescription achieved was 125% of the PTVProstate prescription (53.4 Gy in 7 fractions, EQD21.5 Gy: 139.3 Gy) and ranged from 110% (EQD21.5 Gy: 110.3 Gy) to 140% (EQD21.5 Gy: 171.6 Gy). The median D50% received by a PTVDIL was 55.1 Gy (EQD21.5 Gy: 147.5 Gy); range: 49.6 Gy (EQD21.5 Gy: 121.7 Gy) to 62.6 Gy (EQD21.5 Gy: 186.8 Gy). Unsurprisingly, delivering boosts to PTVDILs compared to not delivering boosts, resulted in significant increases in PTVDIL D50%. This was accompanied by increases in monitor units and estimated delivery times (Table 4). During planning, the rectum was most frequently the dose-limiting structure. For all boost plans (plan sets B, C, and D), linear correlations were observed between the PTVDIL prescription achieved and the minimum distance of a PTVDIL from the rectum (r=0.56, P=.019) and the volume of PTVDIL overlapping with the rectum (r=?0.66, P=.004). In addition, PTVDIL D50% correlated with the volume of PTV_DIL overlapping with the rectum (plan sets B, C and D: r=?0.69, ?0.58, ?0.62; P=.002, P=.016, P=.008, respectively) and, in plan sets B and D, with the minimum distance of PTVDIL from the rectum (plan set B: r=0.62, P=.008, plan set D: r=0.50, P=.045). No significant correlations were observed between PTVDIL minimum distance from, or volume of overlap with, the urethra or bladder and the PTVDIL prescription or D50%. There was no correlation between DIL volume and the PTVDIL prescription or PTVDIL D50%. For smaller volume PTVProstates, respecting conformity index (CI) constraints was an additional dose-limiting factor; and for larger volume PTVs, respecting the maximum dose 2 cm from the PTVProstate (Dmax2 cm) was also dose limiting. When the proxSV were included in the prescription, prescribed 32.4 Gy (plan set C) or 36.5 Gy (plan set D), it was possible to deliver the same PTVDIL prescription as when DILs were boosted without proxSV inclusion. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in PTVDIL D50% (Table 4). Plans prescribing 32.4 Gy to the proxSV (plan set C) compared to plans delivering DIL boosts but without proxSV prescription (plan set B) resulted in significant increases in CI, R50 (volume of 50% isodose/volume of PTV), and Dmax2cm. Similarly, prescribing 36.5 Gy (plan set D) to proxSV, compared to 32.4 Gy (plan set C), resulted in increases in CI, R50, and Dmax2cm (Table 4). TCP for DILs and the non-DIL prostate varied depending on the ?/? ratio and accompanying parameters used (Table 5). For all ?/? ratios, boosting DILs resulted in significant increases in TCP in DILs and non-DIL prostates. The higher the ?/? ratio, the greater the benefit of boosting DILs, with gains in median TCP of 14% (from 76.5%-90.5%) when boosting for an ?/? ratio of 10 Gy compared to 6.7% (90.3%-97.0%) for an ?/? ratio of 3 and 4.4% (94.4%-98.8%) for an ?/? ratio of 1.5 Gy. There were no differences in TCP when the proxSV were included within the prescription. With ?/? ratio of 1.5 Gy in nonboost plans (plan set A), TCP for DILs and for the remaining prostate exceeded 90% and 95%, respectively, in 9 of 10 cases. TCP sensitivity analysis results are shown in Supplementary Table E2. Small changes in TCP input parameters have the greatest impact with an ?/? ratio of ?10 Gy and least impact with an ?/? ratio of ?1.5 Gy. NTCP for grade 2+ late rectal complications (QUANTEC parameters) was consistently low (<3.5%) when prescribing SABR to the whole prostate, without DIL boosting (plan set A; Table 5). There was a significant increase in rectal NTCP when delivering DIL boosts. Prescribing to the proxSV did not increase rectal NTCP further. Rectal NTCP was <15% in 35 of 40 plans. A strong linear correlation was noted between maximum dose received by 0.5 cm3 (Dmax0.5cc) of rectum and rectal NTCP in all boost plans (ie, plan sets B, C, and D; r: 0.88, 0.97, and 0.95 respectively; all P?.001) (see Supplementary Fig. E1). Rectal NTCP did not exceed 5% and 15% in cases where rectal Dmax0.5cc did not exceed 44.1 Gy and 47.1 Gy, respectively."
Prostate_Cancer "There was no correlation between rectal NTCP and PTVDIL prescription or D50%, except in plan set C, where a moderate correlation was observed between rectal NTCP and D50% (r=0.488, P=.047). Of the 5 �worst� rectal NTCP plans (using QUANTEC parameters), 3 came from 1 dataset containing 2 DILs, the larger abutting the rectum, both boosted to 130%. The 2 other worst plans came from 1 dataset containing a large PTVDIL (51.6 cm3) prescribed 125%, which overlapped with the rectum. All 5 cases were replanned with the aim of delivering the same PTVDIL prescription while respecting the existing constraints (Table 1) and also reducing rectal Dmax0.5cc to <47.1 Gy. In 4 cases the same PTVDIL prescription level was achieved, albeit with lower PTVDIL D50%. Rectal NTCP was reduced considerably (from 30.8%, 47.1%, 31.9%, and 22.6% to 1.7%, 3.4%, 2.5%, and 8.9%), accompanied by small reductions in DIL TCP (Supplementary Table E3). In 1 case, it was not possible to maintain coverage, to respect constraints, and to lower rectal dose, so PTVDIL prescription was lowered by 5% to 120%, which resulted in reduced rectal NTCP (31% to 5.6%). Thus, rectal NTCP became <15% in all cases. Anorectal NTCP based on alternative parameters was generally acceptable. Results are presented in Supplementary Table E4 and discussed in Supplementary Materials. Discussion This study investigated boosting DILs while maintaining organ-at-risk constraints in the context of SABR. DIL dose escalation to a median of 125% of the PTVProstate prescription (EQD21.5: 139 Gy) is feasible. This resulted in increased TCP in DILs and the non-DIL prostate, likely because of the dose gradients required to deliver boosts. DIL boosting also increased rectal NTCP, and, in some cases, rectal NTCP became unacceptable. Simultaneous EBRT DIL boosts up to 4.1 Gy and 2.7 Gy per fraction have been delivered in planning and clinical studies respectively, to total doses up to EQD21.5 220 Gy and 114 Gy (3,6-13). The non-DIL prostate received up to 2.8 Gy and 2.7 Gy per fraction in planning and clinical settings respectively (up to EQD21.5: 93.5 Gy and 81.4 Gy) (3,6-13). Late grade 2+ rectal and bladder toxicity rates up to 15% and 43% are reported clinically (3). We are unaware of other publications which examined TCP and NTCP using SABR to the whole prostate (EQD21.5: 92.7 Gy) with simultaneous SABR DIL boosts. Previous studies have observed the impact of DIL location on boost feasibility (7,11). We also found that PTVDIL proximity to the rectum and volume of rectal overlap influenced the PTVDIL prescription level and PTVDIL D50%. Unlike studies using conventional fractionation, prescribing SABR requires limits for high- and intermediate-dose spill. These also influenced the boosts that could be achieved. It was possible to prescribe the same PTVDIL prescriptions and achieve similar PTVDIL median doses when including the proxSV, when prescribing both 32.4 Gy and 36.5 Gy. This potentially provides an SABR option for intermediate-risk PCa patients at higher risk of SV invasion. Including the proxSV resulted in �pulling out� of isodoses posteriorly, reflected by increases in CI and R50. Despite this, there was no significant increase in rectal NTCP. This study has limitations, and several factors must be addressed before adopting this strategy clinically. First, the optimal method for defining DILs is debated. Existing studies use multiparametric MRI, MR spectroscopy, radio-labeled indium and choline positron emission tomography. We used multiparametric MRI, in keeping with guidelines (1). Based on histopathological correlation with prostatectomy specimens, T2-weighted sequences combined with DW MRI sequences, or DW combined with DCE MRI sequences, have sensitivities and specificities of 70% to 87% (23, 24). Combining all 3 sequences has been shown to result in a receiver operator curve area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (25). Second, accurate image coregistration is essential. We used soft tissue automatch with manual correction as necessary. Deformable registration might prove superior, as this could deal with alterations in prostate shape and discrepancies in prostate size between imaging modalities more adequately than we were able to using rigid registration but this has not been validated in the setting of DILs. The optimal method of registration might well include models which add additional DIL margins to specifically account for registration errors, although techniques requiring additional margins may prove difficult to implement without unacceptable increases in NTCP. Uncertainties resulting from DIL definition and registration will reduce the actual TCP benefit achieved from DIL boosting to less than that calculated here. Third, the addition of catheterization at planning would facilitate reliable identification of the urethra. Fourth, robust image guidance together with appropriate CTV-PTV margins are essential. We used 6-mm prostate CTV-PTV margins, compatible with daily online fiducial-based image guidance (without intrafraction motion tracking) (26). There is evidence that intrafraction motion becomes more problematic with increasing treatment time, particularly beyond 8 min (27). Our plans had average estimated delivery times of 4.2 minutes (maximum, 5.9 minutes). We therefore do not envision that intrafraction motion would be a major concern. The use of flattening filter�free (FFF) treatments would further reduce delivery times. We replanned 5 boost plans using FFF and estimated delivery times reduced by 116 seconds on average. "
Prostate_Cancer "While intensity modulated radiation therapy (rather than VMAT) could potentially achieve similar boosts, the longer delivery times would be more of a concern in the absence of intrafraction motion tracking. Fifth, the most appropriate DIL CTV-PTV margin is uncertain. A variety of margins have previously been adopted (0-8 mm) (3). The phase 3 Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer (FLAME) trial, which prescribes 77 Gy in 35 fractions to the prostate, with or without 95 Gy simultaneous DIL boost, uses 4-mm DIL CTV-PTV margins (12). We also used 4-mm margins. The concept of a DIL CTV-PTV margin within a larger (ie, whole prostate) PTV margin is not consistent with the derivation of margins using the traditional van Herk methods, which are based on the CTV receiving the appropriate dose with a standard penumbra of 5 mm, and doses falling from 95% at the edge of the PTV to 20% at the edge of the penumbra (28). In the case of DILs, doses were falling from a median of 125% to approximately 100%. Furthermore, the dose fall-off around the DILs was relatively shallow, such that each DIL was generally well encompassed within the 95% isodose relevant to that DIL, thus adding additional coverage security to that created by the 4-mm CTV-PTV DIL margin to help account for intrafraction motion as well as uncertainties in DIL definition and registration. Adequately addressing the above issues, while relevant in the context of conventional fractionation, is even more important in the context of SABR, where the TCP and NTCP consequences of inaccurate dose delivery are greater. The optimal organ-at-risk constraints for prostate SABR are unknown. We adopted the same constraints as a phase 3 trial, which delivers the same PTVProstate prescription dose (29), and added additional constraints. Despite this relatively conservative approach, plans which included DIL boosts were sometimes associated with unacceptable rectal NTCP. The �acceptable� level of grade 2+ late rectal complications has not been defined. QUANTEC suggests constraints for conventional 3D-conformal RT which should result in ?15% late grade 2+ rectal complications (21). Most of our plans satisfied this limit, but 5 did not. Strong correlations between rectal Dmax0.5cc and rectal NTCP were demonstrated. This is not surprising as NTCP modelling considered the rectum as a serial structure, thus higher doses have greater impact on NTCP. Replanning the 5 �worst� cases, aiming to reduce rectal Dmax0.5cc yet still deliver the highest possible boost, resulted in considerable reductions in rectal NTCP, and only once was it necessary to reduce the PTVDIL prescription to achieve this. When considering alternative NTCP parameters for anorectal toxicities and personalizing NTCP based on a history of abdominal surgery, NTCP levels were generally low. Those cases in which NTCP levels were highest, based on alternative parameters, were those in which rectal NTCP was unacceptable using QUANTEC parameters, and the replans predicted acceptable NTCP levels. The applicability of our modeling approach in the SABR setting is uncertain (21). The TCP and NTCP models used rely on the LQ model. There is debate about the appropriateness of this model at high doses per fraction, therefore calling into question the validity of our calculations (30,31). Two points, however, should be emphasized. First, the concern about the validity of the LQ model begins at fraction sizes of at least 10 Gy (30,31), while the doses in this study were <10 Gy per fraction. Second, the concern regarding the LQ model at high doses per fraction is that it overestimates cell killing, thus overestimating NTCP (31). The potential inaccuracies in our calculations can therefore be considered �safe.� Regarding TCP, sensitivity analysis revealed TCPs based on an ?/? ratio of ?1.5 Gy are most robust to small changes in input parameters. If the �true� TCP parameters for ultrahypofractionation are slightly different from those adopted here and if the PCa ?/? ratio is ?1.5 Gy, then these will be the most reliable TCP calculations. Long-term clinical SABR data are required before these issues can be resolved. The differences between DILs and the non-DIL prostate are incompletely understood. We assumed a higher clonogenic density in DILs than the remaining prostate and therefore handled the DILs and non-DIL prostate separately. If DILs are the most likely source of local failure, then TCPs calculated for DILs are more relevant. CTVs were used for TCP calculations instead of PTVs, thus avoiding the uncertainties which arise as the CTV-PTV margin contains a lower clonogenic density than that of the CTV. The ?/? ratio for PCa is debated. TCP varied with the ?/? ratio adopted: ?/? = 1.5 Gy resulted in the highest TCP, and the benefit of boosting DILs was least in this setting. Indeed, in nonboost plans, ?/? = 1.5 Gy resulted in TCP >94% and >89% for the non-DIL prostate and DILs, respectively. Nonboost plans were also associated with low rectal NTCP, and so, if PCa ?/? is ?1.5 Gy, then prostate SABR without DIL boosting is safe and acceptable. If the ?/? ratio is higher, then TCP is more limited, even with DIL boosting, and further increases in TCP would cause unacceptable increases in rectal NTCP. As mentioned above, the uncertainties associated with DIL definition and registration will result in the realized TCP from boosting being less than that calculated, thus reinforcing the role of SABR to the whole prostate without DIL boosting if the ?/? ratio of PCa is ?1.5 Gy. Although this planning study included some patients with higher risk disease than we would envision treating with this technique, our approach was justifiable as approximately 43% of patients with low- to intermediate-risk PCa have DILs identifiable on MRI (32). Most patients also received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, which is used less frequently in lower risk patients. If adopted clinically, the impact of hormone therapy on DIL appearance would need to be considered where relevant (33). Conclusions Accepting these limitations and uncertainties, it is technically feasible to create SABR VMAT plans which boost DILs. This increases TCP. Rectal NTCP also increases and can become unacceptable, although high levels of rectal NTCP can be reduced by minimizing maximum rectal doses. TCP is influenced by prostate ?/? ratio. The higher the true ?/? ratio in PCa, the smaller the gap between doses required for adequate tumor control and acceptable rectal toxicity. "

All rights reserved. 2014 Objective The purpose of this article is to review the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) of the prostate and MR-guided prostate biopsy, and their role in the evaluation and management of men with low-risk prostate cancer. Methods We performed a literature review based on the MEDLINE database search for publications on the role of mMRI (a) in detection and localization of prostate cancer, prediction of tumor aggressiveness and progression and (b) in guiding targeted prostate biopsy. Results The mMRI, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging with T2-weighted imaging, is a useful tool for tumor localization in low-risk prostate cancer as it can detect lesions that are more likely missed on extended biopsy schemes and can identify clinically significant disease requiring definitive treatment. The MR-guided biopsy of the most suspicious lesions enables more accurate and safer approach to guide enrollment into the active surveillance program. However, the MR-guided biopsy is complex. The fusion of MRI data with transrectal ultrasound for the purpose of biopsy provides a more feasible technique with documented accurate sampling. Conclusion Although the mMRI is not routinely used for risk stratification and prognostic assessment in prostate cancer, it can provide valuable information to guide management of men with low-risk disease. Incorporation of mMRI into the workup and monitoring of patients with low-risk prostate cancer can help discriminate clinically significant disease from indolent disease. Targeted biopsy of MR-suspicious lesions enables accurate sampling of potentially aggressive tumors that may affect outcomes.

Advanced prostate cancer has been recognized as being responsive to androgen deprivation since the 1940s when Charles Huggins first described the role of surgical castration in managing these patients. However, androgen deprivation only results in transient disease control for the vast majority of men, with those progressing in spite of castrate testosterone levels labeled as having castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Until 2004, the therapeutic arena for these patients had remained stagnant, with no agent having shown a survival gain in the CRPC setting. Two landmark publications changed the prostate cancer treatment landscape by providing �level-1 evidence� that docetaxel-based chemotherapy led to prolongation in overall survival (OS). This was followed by the approval of cabazitaxel in 2010 on the basis of Phase III data demonstrating its efficacy in patients pretreated with docetaxel. More recently, a number of next-generation androgen-directed agents (e.g. abiraterone and enzalutamide) have also been shown to lead to a survival benefit in men with CRPC. With so many new treatment options available, a number of questions remain. These include: how to best sequence chemotherapy with these newer hormonal agents, the clinical implication of cross-resistance between taxanes and androgen-directed agents and which subsets of patients may benefit most from early use of chemotherapy. This review will provide an overview of the evolving role of chemotherapy in the management of advanced prostate cancer in the current era. cabazitaxel chemotherapy cyclophosphamide docetaxel mitoxantrone prostate cancer taxanes INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer remains a major health concern, with an estimated 238 590 new cases and 29 720 deaths expected in the United States in 2013.1 Since the 1940s, the initial management of advanced prostate cancer has entailed androgen ablation�either through surgical or medical castration (i.e. androgen deprivation therapy).2 In spite of greater than 90% of men initially responding to androgen ablation, the disease will almost universally progress.3 Upon progression despite androgen deprivation therapy, and in the presence of persistently suppressed serum testosterone levels (<50 ng dl?1), patients are labeled as having castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)."
Prostate_Cancer "4 Until 2004, the therapeutic arena had remained stagnant, with no agent having shown a survival gain in the CRPC setting. The landmark publications in 2004 by Petrylak and colleagues as well as Tannock and colleagues changed the prostate cancer treatment landscape by providing �level-1 evidence� that docetaxel and prednisone, either with or without estramustine, lead to prolongation in overall survival (OS).56 More recently, the management of men with CRPC has made additional strides with the advent of newer androgen-directed therapies.7 These agents have been developed in the context of realizing that tumors in men with CRPC are still largely dependent on AR signaling.8 Indeed, a number of mechanisms have been elucidated by which androgen receptor (AR) signaling may continue to drive prostate cancer growth in spite of castrate serum testosterone levels. These included: (i) upregulation of the AR, (ii) increased extragonadal (adrenal, intratumoral and prostatic) testosterone synthesis via the cytochrome P450�17 (CYP-17) biosynthesis pathway, (iii) the emergence of constitutively activated AR splice variants, (iv) activation of androgen-AR signaling via alternative pathways and (v) AR coactivator expression.9101112131415 Mechanistically, these newer androgen-directed agents work primarily through ligand depletion (e.g. abiraterone and orteronel) or through interference with AR trafficking and signaling (e.g. enzalutamide and ARN-509), with abiraterone and enzalutamide recently becoming approved for men with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).161718 With this explosion in the number of oral androgen-directed therapies either approved or expected to gain approval in coming years, the question remains as to what role chemotherapy will play in the management of patients with mCRPC and how it will fit into our contemporary treatment paradigm. Furthermore, evidence has begun to emerge that taxanes may partially function through inhibiting AR expression and trafficking into the nucleus of prostate cancer cells, leaving the possibility that the taxanes and newer androgen-directed therapies may have a significant degree of cross-resistance.1920 In this article, we will review the currently approved chemotherapeutics for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer with a focus on mechanisms of action, evidence of efficacy, mechanisms of resistance and potential interaction with some of the newer androgen-directed therapies. EARLY EXPERIENCE WITH CHEMOTHERAPY IN PROSTATE CANCER Mitoxantrone The anthracenedione mitoxantrone was approved in 1996 for men with symptomatic mCRPC on the basis of data that it led to improvements in quality of life (QoL) and pain reduction.2122 A Phase III multicenter Canadian study randomized 161 men with mCRPC and bone pain to either prednisone or mitoxantrone plus prednisone.21 A palliative response, defined as a 2-point decrease in pain assessed using a 6-point pain scale (or complete loss of pain if initially 1+), was the primary endpoint. The mitoxantrone-prednisone combination was found to lead to significantly more men achieving a palliative response (29% vs 12%; P = 0.01). However, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (i.e. ?50% PSA declines) between groups was not different (33% vs 22%, P = 0.11) and no difference in OS was observed either. A secondary analysis of QoL on that study was subsequently reported by Osoba and colleagues.22 QoL was assessed using two surveys: the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14). Overall, those in the mitoxantrone-prednisone groups were found to have significant improvements in global QoL compared to controls (P = 0.009). Given these encouraging palliative benefits and the lack of alternative therapeutic options at that time, mitoxantrone (given together with prednisone) was approved for men with mCRPC. The aforementioned trial was not powered to detect differences in survival between those receiving mitoxantrone versus those that did not. A larger trial (n = 242) conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), the CALGB 9182 study, was developed in an attempt to determine if mitoxantrone produced improvements in OS.23 While PSA responses (i.e. ?50% PSA decline) were more common (38% vs 22%, P = 0.008) and there was a significant delay in progression-free survival (PFS) with the combination of mitoxantrone plus hydrocortisone compared to hydrocortisone alone (median PFS 3.7 vs 2.3 months, P = 0.022), no difference in OS between the groups was observed (median OS 12.7 vs 12.3 months, P > 0.05). Furthermore, when the mitoxantrone group was compared to the placebo group there were no differences in objective radiographic responses (i.e. complete response plus partial response rate; 7% vs 4%, P = 0.375) or in global QoL as assessed using the Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC). There were differences between the two groups in the emotional state subscale, family disruption subscale and two pain items. The lack of clear objective benefits reported in these two trials illustrated the profound need for more effective treatment options during this time period. At the current time, despite the lack of survival benefit with mitoxantrone, this chemotherapy may still have a role in the second-line (post-docetaxel) setting in particular patients. Although the novel taxane agent cabazitaxel is superior to mitoxantrone in this setting (see TROPIC trial, below), mitoxantrone is associated with lower rates of myelosuppression and may be a reasonable chemotherapy option in a patient with poor bone marrow reserves or performance status 2�3. Because of its palliative effects, mitoxantrone may be especially useful in docetaxel-pretreated patients with symptomatic bone pain who may not tolerate cabazitaxel. Cyclophosphamide Another chemotherapeutic option commonly utilized in the pre-docetaxel era to treat men with mCRPC was oral cyclophosphamide. A handful of investigators have reported response rates in the range of 20%�40% when given as monotherapy or in combination with other agents (both PSA and objective response criteria).24252627282930 In one of the early studies, Raghavan and colleagues administered cyclophosphamide at 100 mg daily by mouth on days 1�14 of a 28-day cycle. Thirty patients were treated in total, and they reported a median OS of 12.7 months from the date of cyclophosphamide initiation, partial responses (per the National Prostatic Cancer Project criteria) in six (20%) subjects and disease stabilization in 13 (43%) subjects.24 In addition, 18 (60%) patients experienced a major reduction in tumor-associated symptoms and 21 (70%)"
Prostate_Cancer "had significant pain reductions. Another report by Nicolini and colleagues (n = 8) evaluated continuously-dosed oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 100�150 mg daily.26 They reported two partial responses and three patients with stable disease while the other three subjects progressed (per Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group criteria). In those who responded to treatment (n = 5), the median OS from the time of cyclophosphamide commencement was 17 months and duration of clinical benefit was reported at 9 months. In addition, a number of trials have evaluated cyclophosphamide in combination with other chemotherapeutics (e.g. etoposide, estramustine and tegafur), and while response rates may appear to be slightly improved compared to monotherapy, to the best of our knowledge there have been no trials directly comparing cyclophosphamide combination therapy to monotherapy.272829 MICROTUBULE-MODULATING AGENTS Microtubules are dynamic filamentous proteins that are implicated in a range of cellular functions including: providing integrity and preserving cellular architecture, mitosis, cellular protein transport, cell signaling and gene expression.3132 Microtubules are composed of polymerized tubulin, which exists as a heterodimer of alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits. A guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-fueled equilibrium between the free and polymerized tubulin subunits is responsible for a state referred to as �dynamic equilibrium�, leading to the plasticity exhibited by microtubules and their resultant broad range of functions. Given the host of vital cellular functions that microtubules are involved in, a number of antineoplastic agents have been developed to act as microtubule inhibitors. To date, the most efficacious chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer all function as microtubule inhibitors (i.e. docetaxel, cabazitaxel and estramustine). Interestingly, while �chemotherapy� is traditionally not considered targeted therapy, a number of preclinical experiments have implicated microtubules in androgen-AR signaling. Given the well-described link between AR signaling and prostate cancer proliferation, this potentially provides a mechanistic insight into why agents like docetaxel are effective prostate cancer therapies; whereas, other chemotherapeutics have produced only marginal response rates.31 It has recently emerged that taxanes are able to modulate AR-mediated transcription, as evidenced by their ability to decrease expression of the androgen-mediated genes PSA and NKX3.1, while increasing expression of maspin (an androgen-repressed gene).33 It has also been shown that taxane-based therapies are able to inhibit AR nuclear localization through the disruption of normal microtubule function.19 Human prostate tissue microarrays from subjects who were pre- and post-docetaxel treatment have also demonstrated decreased AR nuclear localization following treatment with docetaxel (50% nuclear localization in chemotherapy-na�ve specimens compared to 38% in docetaxel-pretreated specimens).19 Furthermore, a small pilot study evaluating the effect of taxanes on AR localization in circulating tumor cells from patients confirmed this finding. In that study, taxane-responders were defined as having a ?30% decline in PSA, progressors as having > 25% PSA increase and stable disease fulfilling neither of these criteria. The investigators found that 12/17 patients (70.6%) with response or stable disease had cytoplasmic AR localization, while 13/18 (72%) of progressors had nuclear AR localization (P = 0.02).34 Estramustine Estramsutine was initially approved for men with CRPC in 1984. It is a nitrogen mustard-estradiol conjugate that was originally designed for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cells; however, significant ER binding is not observed nor does it display clinical effects consistent with other alkylating agents (e.g. neutropenia).31 It is a somewhat unique agent in that it has been shown to exert both hormonal and non-hormonal effects.35 The metabolic products of estramustine phosphate (the parent compound) include estrone and estradiol. These two metabolites have been shown to exert anti-gonadotrophic properties leading to decreases in serum testosterone.36 Estramustine, the key cytotoxic metabolite, on the other hand has been shown to cause microtubule depolymerization through a direct tubulin interaction.37 Additionally, in vitro data demonstrate a strong degree of synergy between estramustine and a number of other chemotherapeutic agents.38 Early monotherapy trials revealed only modest anti-prostate cancer effects. As part of the National Prostatic Cancer Project (NPCP), six randomized trials evaluated estramustine as monotherapy. Only 5% of 304 total enrolled patients had objective responses.3940 Other studies of single-agent estramustine have demonstrated objective response rates in the range of 20%�50%.31 While only modestly effective as a single-agent, based on the aforementioned preclinical work, it was hypothesized that estramustine may exhibit synergy with other microtubule-inhibiting and cytotoxic agents. As such, a number of combination studies were conducted in the 1990s to mid-2000s�the most well-known of which was the Phase III Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 9916 study that demonstrated a survival advantage with the combination of estramustine and docetaxel compared to mitoxantrone.54142 Docetaxel Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane, which functions as a microtubule inhibitor through binding to beta-tubulin and preventing microtubule disassembly. This inability to disassemble effectively �locks� microtubules in a polymerized state, halting dynamic equilibrium and resulting in the disruption of key microtubule functions such as mitosis (typically at the G2/M phase) and AR nuclear translocation.193443 In addition, there is evidence that docetaxel is capable of inhibiting expression of BCL-2 and BCL-X, two anti-apoptotic genes, thereby promoting apoptosis (Table 1).4344 Table 1 Postulated mechanisms of action and resistance for docetaxel A number of early-phase trials evaluating the utility of single-agent and combination therapy with docetaxel plus estramustine have been completed. Typically, these studies have evaluated either weekly or every-3-week dosing schedules, with 30 and 75 mg m?2 being the most frequently employed doses, respectively. Both schedules have demonstrated efficacy in the Phase II setting. For instance, two trials evaluating a 21-day dosing schedule reported partial objective response rates of 17%�28% and PSA declines ?50% in 38�46% of patients.4546 Similarly, a Phase II study testing a weekly schedule of docetaxel (6 weeks on, 2 weeks off) demonstrated ?50% PSA declines in 41% of patients and a median OS of 9.4 months.47 Based on these encouraging early-phase data, docetaxel was moved to Phase III testing and was approved in the mCRPC setting on the basis of two landmark Phase III trials: the TAX-327 study and the SWOG-9916 study.56 The first trial by Tannock and colleagues (TAX-327) randomized patients to prednisone (5 mg twice daily) plus one of three chemotherapy regimens: docetaxel 75 mg m?2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (n = 335), docetaxel 30 mg m?2 weekly for the first 5 weeks of a 6 week cycle (n = 334) or mitoxantrone 12 mg m?2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (n = 337). The median OS observed in the 21-day schedule of docetaxel, weekly schedule of docetaxel and mitoxantrone groups were 18.9, 17.4 and 16.5 months, respectively. "
Prostate_Cancer "Only the 21-day schedule was found to lead to a statistically significant increase in OS compared to the mitoxantrone arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62�0.94; P = 0.009), while the HR for survival fell just short of significant for the weekly docetaxel dosing schedule (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75�1.11; P = 0.36). The response rate for the 21-day schedule of docetaxel was 35% compared to 22% for mitoxantrone (P = 0.01). Updated survival data from TAX-327 demonstrated that the survival advantage seen with 21-day docetaxel has persisted, and in fact the median OS with longer follow-up increased to 19.2 months compared to 16.3 months with mitoxantrone (P = 0.004) (still without a significant improvement with weekly docetaxel).48 In addition, there were significant improvements in pain and QoL scores for those receiving the 21-day schedule of docetaxel. A subsequent post hoc analysis revealed that those with significant pain at enrollment were most likely to experience improvements in QoL (92% vs 75%, P < 0.001), speaking to the palliative benefits of this regimen in those with more symptomatic disease.49 Most types of adverse events were more common with docetaxel compared to mitoxantrone. There was notably no difference in the frequency of adverse events with weekly docetaxel compared with the 21-day docetaxel schedule. Grade ?3 toxicities seen with docetaxel included anemia (5%), thrombocytopenia (1%) and neutropenia (32%). Other adverse events of interest include: diarrhea (32%), sensory neuropathy (30%), stomatitis (20%) and peripheral edema (19%). The second Phase III trial testing docetaxel in men with mCRPC (SWOG-9916) was published by Petrylak and colleagues.5 In that report, docetaxel was combined with estramustine, an agent that had demonstrated modest single-agent activity, but displayed evidence of synergy with other microtubule-inhibiting agents in both the preclinical and clinical setting.3841 In that trial, men were randomized to one of two regimens (both administered on a 21-day schedule): estramustine 280 mg three time daily on days 1�5, docetaxel 60 mg m?2 on day 2 and dexamethasone 60 mg in three divided doses prior to docetaxel (n = 338) versus mitoxantrone 12 mg m?2 on day 1 plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily (n = 336). Again, docetaxel was shown to lead to a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to mitoxantrone in this trial, with the median OS reported at 17.5 and 15.6 months, respectively (P = 0.02). PSA declines ?50% were observed in 50% of patients treated in the docetaxel arm compared to 27% of those in the mitoxantrone arm (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in objective tumor responses between the two arms. Unlike TAX-327, SWOG-9916 failed to show any differences in pain control between the two groups. While direct comparison between these two Phase III studies is fraught with problems, the results from the TAX-327 trial perhaps imply slightly better outcomes compared to the SWOG-9916 study. A Phase II trial randomizing 150 patients between docetaxel either with or without estramustine found that, while PSA response rates were not statistically different, toxicities were increased with the addition of estramustine to docetaxel. In total, grade 3/4 toxicities occurred in 45% compared to 21% (P = 0.005) in the docetaxel-estramustine and docetaxel groups, respectively.50 In addition, the use of estramustine has been associated with venous thromboembolic events. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines reflect these observations and recommend against the addition of estramustine to docetaxel in the treatment of mCRPC.51 Cabazitaxel One of the proposed mechanisms by which docetaxel resistance may emerge is through the P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance efflux pump.52535455 Cabazitaxel is a next-generation taxane, which like docetaxel, functions through binding beta-tubulin and preventing depolymerization of microtubules.31 While it displays similar anticancer efficacy to docetaxel in taxane-sensitive in vitro models, it has been shown to have enhanced efficacy in cell lines with P-glycoprotein overexpression.56 This data formed the basis for testing cabazitaxel in the post-docetaxel setting in men with mCRPC. The seminal Phase III TROPIC trial assessed prednisone 10 mg daily plus cabazitaxel 25 mg m?2 (n = 378) versus mitoxantrone 12 mg m?2 (n = 377) in men with mCRPC who had progressed during or after treatment with docetaxel.57 The median survival with cabazitaxel in this trial was 15.1 months compared to 12.7 months with mitoxantrone (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59�0.83; P < 0�0001). There was no improvement in pain with cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone. Radiographic (14.4% vs 4.4%, P = 0.0005) and ?50% PSA response rates (39.2% vs 17.8%, P = 0.0002) were observed at a higher frequency with cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone. Grade ?3 adverse events that were more frequently seen with cabazitaxel included neutropenia (82%) and diarrhea (6%). Interestingly, unlike docetaxel, peripheral neuropathy was rare, with grade-3 neuropathy occurring in < 1% of patients and all-grade neuropathy in 14% of patients treated with cabazitaxel. While not statistically different, there were more treatment-related deaths (i.e. within 30 days of last infusion) observed in the cabazitaxel arm (5% vs 2%), raising potential questions about cabazitaxel's safety especially in elderly populations. It should be noted, however, that the TROPIC trial precluded the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as primary prophylaxis. Based on the aforementioned safety concerns, it is now recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines as well as the cabazitaxel prescribing information brochure to consider granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis in high-risk patients (e.g. age > 65 years, poor performance status, prior episodes of febrile neutropenia, extensive prior radiation ports, poor nutritional status or other serious comorbidities). "
Prostate_Cancer "Ultimately, based on the favorable overall results of the TROPIC trial, the Food and Drug Administration approved cabazitaxel in 2010 for the second-line treatment of patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel. This approval has, in turn, resulted in a diminished use of mitoxantrone (although the latter may still be a reasonable option in men who may not tolerate cabazitaxel). It should be noted that both cabazitaxel 20 and 25 mg m?2 every 21 days were recommended for Phase II/III testing based on early-phase trials.565859 Whether or not 20 mg m?2 of cabazitaxel may be equally efficacious compared to the 25 mg m?2 dose tested in the TROPIC trial is not known. According to the TROPIC investigators, the decision to proceed with 25 mg m?2 was made given the desire to assess �as effective a dose as possible� as well as data from a Phase II trial in breast cancer patients showing that an increase in dose from 20 to 25 mg m?2 was not associated with increased toxicity.60 Needless to say, it remains unclear if a lower dose of cabazitaxel (i.e. 20 mg m?2) would have an improved therapeutic ratio with equipotent antitumor efficacy. The PROSELICA trial, a Phase III noninferiority trial with an OS primary endpoint, was launched in order to answer this question by randomizing docetaxel-pretreated patients between these two dose levels (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01308580). Another question that remains unanswered is whether cabazitaxel is effective pre-docetaxel (i.e. in the first-line setting). Several trials have been launched in an effort to address this issue. The phase III FIRSTANA trial randomizes patients between three arms: cabazitaxel 20 mg m?2, cabazitaxel 25 mg m?2 or docetaxel 75 mg m?2 (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01308567). All are given in conjunction with prednisone and are dosed on a 21-day schedule. Enrollment to this trial was recently completed, and patients will now be followed for survival. Another study which evaluates first-line cabazitaxel is the phase II TAXYNERGY trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01718353).61 In that trial, chemotherapy-untreated mCRPC subjects are randomized 2: 1 to either docetaxel 75 mg m?2 every 3 weeks (potentially followed by cabazitaxel) versus cabazitaxel 25 mg m?2 every 3 weeks (potentially followed by docetaxel), with a therapy switch occurring in patients who fail to achieve a PSA decline of ?30% after four cycles of first-line taxane therapy (patients who do achieve a ?30% PSA reduction in the first four cycles remain on the same taxane agent). The primary endpoint of TAXYNERGY is the PSA response rate (i.e. ?50% PSA decline) during the whole treatment period, while PFS and OS are important secondary endpoints. In addition, this trial is evaluating microtubule engagement and trafficking of the AR using circulating tumor cells collected at baseline and at various follow-up time points, in an effort to understand mechanisms of response and resistance to both taxane agents.62 These two trials will provide valuable information regarding the optimal sequencing of these two chemotherapeutics and the role of cabazitaxel in treating docetaxel-na�ve patients. COMBINATION TRIALS The collective experience from a host of other malignancies has provided the impetus to evaluate combination therapeutic regimens as a means to improve response rates compared to single-agent chemotherapy. Unfortunately, to date, no combination regimen has proven to afford a survival advantage compared to single-agent taxane therapy alone. Docetaxel in combination with atrasentan, lenalidomide, aflibercept, bevacizumab and dasatinib (amongst other agents) have all proven to not be superior to single-agent docetaxel with respect to OS.6364656667 While there are several potential explanations for the failure of eight consecutive phase III �docetaxel-plus� studies, perhaps the most concerning observation was the lack of positive well-designed phase II trials before embarking on phase III testing.68 A similar large number of trials evaluating cabazitaxel in various combinations are currently underway (Table 2).55 Table 2 Ongoing cabazitaxel-based combination trials One potential strategy explored in earlier Phase trials is combing chemotherapy with an AR-targeted agent such as ketoconazole, abiraterone or enzalutamide. A Phase I study conducted at the National Cancer Institutes evaluated ketoconazole combined with weekly docetaxel.69 This study reported PSA responses (?50% PSA declines) in 62% of enrolled subjects. Furthermore, radiographic partial responses occurred in seven (28%) of 25 patients with soft tissue disease. A recently reported Phase I trial has shown that enzalutamide plus docetaxel is well-tolerated, and that docetaxel pharmacokinetics were not augmented by the coadministration of enzalutamide.70 An additional Phase I study evaluating abiraterone in combination with docetaxel is ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01400555)."
Prostate_Cancer "Whether this strategy of combining next generation androgen-directed agents and taxane-based chemotherapy will prove more effective than either single agent alone remains to be seen. Currently, the only Phase III docetaxel-based combination trial with results still pending is a study of docetaxel with or without custirsen (previously called OGX-011). Custirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of the cytoprotective chaperone gene clusterin that has shown promise in two randomized Phase II trials.7172 Chi and colleagues reported that in chemotherapy-na�ve patients randomized to docetaxel and prednisone with or without custirsen, there was a significant improvement in OS (a secondary endpoint) with the addition of custirsen when other relevant covariables were controlled for (HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29�0.87).71 Saad and colleagues tested custirsen in patients progressing on docetaxel.72 In that trial, subjects received prednisone and were randomized to also receive mitoxantrone plus custirsen or docetaxel retreatment plus custirsen. The docetaxel and mitoxantrone arms achieved a median OS of 15.8 and 11.5 months, respectively. Based on these results, two Phase III trials were launched. The SYNERGY trial is investigating custirsen in chemotherapy-na�ve patients (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01188187). In that trial, subjects are being randomized to docetaxel-prednisone with or without custirsen. The second Phase III trial, called AFFINITY, is evaluating custirsen in patients who have progressed on docetaxel (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01578655). Patients on this study will receive cabazitaxel-prednisone with or without custirsen. Both trials have chosen OS as their primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS In this era of next-generation androgen-directed therapies (e.g. abiraterone and enzalutamide) the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy is becoming less clear although still has a distinct role. While docetaxel, and to a lesser extent cabazitaxel, remain important treatment options for patients with advanced mCRPC, the efficacy of these newer AR-targeting agents makes these chemotherapies less desirable options for some patients. How to best incorporate cytotoxics into our current treatment paradigms is an issue that needs to be clarified. One strategy would be to reserve cytotoxics for patients with bulky visceral disease, rapidly expanding disease or those requiring rapid palliation. While comparative data between the androgen-directed therapies and chemotherapy are lacking, the fact that docetaxel has been reported to achieve a pain response after only 27 days and a QoL response after 43 days speaks to the rapidity with which chemotherapy is able to exert an antitumor effect.40 As discussed previously, an important consideration when using taxanes is the possibility of cross-resistance with agents that acts to inhibit signaling along the AR pathway (i.e. androgen-directed therapies). In the case of ketoconazole, a less potent CYP17 inhibitor than abiraterone, trends towards shortened PFS and OS with docetaxel therapy have been observed for those pretreated with ketoconazole compared to those that were not.73 However, clinical outcomes with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) did not appear inferior in ketoconazole-pretreated patients in a post hoc analysis of the phase III CALGB-90401 trial.74 Conversely, a small (n = 35) single-arm retrospective analysis of docetaxel outcomes in abiraterone-pretreated patients suggested inferior outcomes in this group compared to historical abiraterone-na�ve patients.75 For instance, median OS was reported at 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.6�19.4 months), which was considerably lower than the 19.2 months (95% CI, 17.5�21.3 months) observed on the TAX-327 study.40 Suffice it to say, the optimal sequence of docetaxel with the newer androgen-directed therapies has yet to be established and is an area of active investigation. If the trend over the last few years persists, androgen-directed therapies will continue to prove efficacious at earlier stages of CRPC, with chemotherapy continuing to move more distally in the treatment paradigm. Currently, key questions that remain unanswered include: how to best sequence chemotherapy with these newer hormonal agents, the clinical implication of cross-resistance between taxanes and androgen-directed agents and which subsets of patients will benefit most from early use of chemotherapy. For the time being, chemotherapy (and docetaxel in particular) remains an important option for some men with prostate cancer; however, the future role of chemotherapies in managing our patients with advanced CRPC remains to be determined.
